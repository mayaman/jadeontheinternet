      caption: This was me practicing and I could not figure out how this Face Zoom effect worked at ALL. Decided I would not be using it.

      caption: Still trash at these head turn transitions. I forgot to set the timer in this one!!! Maybe will incorporate another time…

      caption: This angle was cool but zooming was very unsmooth.

      caption: An actual option for posting, but the zooming was so unsmooth I decided against it.

      caption: I decided the hop was weird in this one…

      caption: Halfway through filming, I must have decided this was a bad run, so was just joking around the second half of the dance. This feels way truer to how I would film a TikTok as me, Maya.

      caption: Second dolphin hop was WEAK.

      caption: Still, weak dolphin. After a lot of these, I moved on to doing the dolphin hop in a more side to side rolly way which is in the main video. Maybe I should actually watch those tutorials I linked at the top and practice. And keep in mind, these are just 4 of 22 (!!) drafts I filmed for this post.
