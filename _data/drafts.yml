  caption: This was me practicing and I could not figure out how this Face Zoom effect worked at ALL. Decided I would not be using it.

  caption: Still trash at these head turn transitions. I forgot to set the timer in this one!!! Maybe will incorporate another time…

  caption: This angle was cool but zooming was very unsmooth.

  caption: An actual option for posting, but the zooming was so unsmooth I decided against it.

  caption: Tried to do the “I am chilling in my bed” angle, but did not think it was really working for me.

  caption: This is another option of text I considered using. The majority of the videos on this trend say something like “pretty, average, or ugly?” Thinking about it though I felt better about not encouraging anyone else to comment “ugly!” and also not promoting more people to post videos with that as a multiple choice option.

  caption: This is after I decided to try to do the head turn thing and forgot to set the timer to stop the video at the right time, so it kept going.

  caption: I decided the hop was weird in this one…

  caption: Halfway through filming, I must have decided this was a bad run, so was just joking around the second half of the dance.

  caption: Second dolphin hop was WEAK.

  caption: Still, weak dolphin. After a lot of these, I moved on to doing the dolphin hop in a more side to side rolly way which is in the main video. Maybe I should actually watch those tutorials I linked at the top and practice. And keep in mind, these are just 4 of 22 (!!) drafts I filmed for this post.
