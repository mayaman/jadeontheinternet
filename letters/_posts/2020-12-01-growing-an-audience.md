Dear gems,

Jade is now one month into living her life on TikTok. Despite previously overdosing daily on social media via Instagram (mostly) and Twitter (sometimes), the TikTok learning curve for me remains steep. Even figuring out the most basic stuff makes me feel like a parent trying to keep up with the “kids these days.” (I’ll admit this is a tired sentiment regarding millennials plus TikTok, but it’s TRUE). Like, at first I couldn’t understand how people were starting their videos so far from the start recording button on their phone. Then, I realized that there’s a built in self timer option. Life changing!

Before officially starting this project, for months I obsessively conceptualized its potential narrative and form. I remember asking my boyfriend: Do you think Jade should start out being “bad” at making TikToks at first and then slowly, visibly improve? He didn’t have an answer, but ultimately I decided that she would just honestly start by trying her best. And her best was my best, which, as it turns out, is truly embarrassingly “bad” anyway.

Looking back at some of Jade’s earliest posts, I am struck by how terrible the lighting looks or how awkward her outfits appear rendered on screen. And that mask-as-shirt in the bathroom series? Horrible! (Minus the stick straight hair, major thank you to my friend’s flash hair/makeup work for making that happen). This may be due to a lack of precedent. Jade and I are very different people in the ways that we choose to render ourselves on screen and that tension definitely makes itself known at the beginning of her journey.

But now looking at her profile, it’s clear that in just one month, Jade’s savviness on the platform has grown. She’s had three videos surpass one thousand views (sadly, none of which are dance videos… thought that was what the app’s all about?). She’s developed her signature hairstyle in her most recent posts (The two little ponytail look… think it makes her look recognizable and also maybe 5 years younger). And she’s acquired some new clothes to help her fit into the well loved TikTok aesthetic. (Still a lot of work to do here, I am scouring Depop every day).

This is all well and great, but Jade is really focused on one very specific kind of growth: her audience. After all, what is a performance if nobody is watching? And on TikTok, less than 1K followers is basically nobody.

So, this month, after a grand total of XXX hours spent on TikTok so far, she plans on putting in the work to play a bigger part. She started out a rookie, testing the waters by posting once every day. This month, she’s posting AT LEAST once a day. This new energy is purely motivated by that tiny little number that floats consistently below her head. (Right now, it’s XXX). If she’s working this hard (and let me tell you, it is HARD) to stage an entertaining show every day, then she wants a full house there to see it.

Charli D’Amelio just passed 100 million followers a few days ago and Jade is about one million times behind that. Seeing so many other girls with hundreds of thousands of followers, Jade can’t help but wonder, what is she doing wrong? Or, rather, what’s wrong with her? @.... Says she’s average attractive, “maybe even a little below, no hate…” . Is that the problem?

Maybe we’ll find out. December is about growing an audience. Tickets to the show are free. We would love to see you out there.

<3,
