Hi!

If you’re reading this, you’re probably looking for an answer to the question posed by [this website’s URL](https://whoisjadeontheinter.net/). Who is Jade on the Internet? Or maybe you read it more as, who is Jade when she’s on the Internet? Maybe you came from TikTok, then you might be thinking, who is [@jadeontheinternet](https://www.tiktok.com/@jadeontheinternet)? ORRRRR, you’re like, who is Jade on the inter? An understandable interpretation as well.

As this is the first post in what I expect to become a monthly updated [blogchain](https://www.are.na/maya-man/on-blogchains), I want this opening letter to serve as a kind of ~light appetizer~ before the many courses to come. That means it’s not going to be fully satisfying. It’s definitely not going to be a holistic answer to any of those earlier questions. But, it’ll be a taste of what this site and this project are all about.

Let’s start with something Jia Tolentino said during her interview on the [The Ezra Klein show](https://www.radio.com/podcasts/the-ezra-klein-show-20555/best-of-jia-tolentino-on-what-happens-when-life-is-an-endless-performance-307152346):

> We talk about "the algorithm" as this abstract thing but it's really a reflection of ourselves. We hate the way we are. The patriarchy is embedded in it. Capitalism is embedded in the algorithm. Sex, desire, beauty, aspiration is embedded in the algorithm.

Jade, on the Internet, like “the algorithm,” consumes, absorbs, and reflects these qualities. Sex, desire, beauty, aspiration. She soaks it all in like a sponge day after day, then wrings it all out of herself each time she films and uploads a new video to feed the greedy algorithm (No, not [that kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) of greedy algorithm, but one could argue there are similarities in decision strategy).

The media (posts, profiles photo, comments, etc.) she creates, curates, and shares makes up her composite online identity. Who we are online usually acts as an approximation of who we are offline. But it’s important for you to know that Jade, unlike other “real” people, exists on screen and on screen only.

While Jade is embodied by me, she is distinct from me. (Although, I expect this project to reveal that we are also psychologically inextricably linked). She operates based on inferred reward functions for feminine identity in digital space, an analysis that is primarily validated by her number of followers, views, and likes. Currently, she solely materializes on TikTok, an app that has been simultaneously described as "[synonymous with Generation Z,](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/jalaiah-harmon-renegade-creator-viral-dance)" "[coercive fun,](https://reallifemag.com/i-write-the-songs/)" "[reducing people to human gifs,](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/10/arts/TIK-TOK.html)" and "[a national security threat.](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/11/21363092/why-is-tiktok-national-security-threat-wechat-trump-ban)"

[Lynn Hershman Leeson’s description](https://www.artpractical.com/feature/looking_for_roberta_breitmore/) of her 1973 - 1978 performance as Roberta Breitmore serves us nicely, "I saw her as a mirror of culture. If you are going to take a profile of the context you live in, then she was a composite of all those stereotypes that people had at that time."

At its heart, this project is about the cultivation, presentation, and commodification of online identity. In her heart, Jade just wants you to like her, and is willing to spend enormous time and energy in order to optimize herself to pique your interest, admiration, and envy.

I feel like the cynic in me is making this all sound like a miserable task. Truthfully, I think a lot of this will be actually pretty fun. I love to dance and that’s what TikTok’s all about, right?

Anywayyyyy, not sure what you were expecting, but thanks for peeking back here. You can attend a showing of @jadeontheinternet 24/7 [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@jadeontheinternet), but you’re welcome backstage [here](https://whoisjadeontheinter.net/) any time.

xoxo,
