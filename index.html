            <i>Jade on the Internet</i>
            (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jadeontheinternet">@jadeontheinternet</a>) is an
            ongoing project and TikTok-based
            performance by <a target="_blank" href="https://mayaontheinter.net">Maya
                Man</a> focused
            on the cultivation, presentation, and
            monetization of
            femme identity on the Internet.

        <span class="jade-is">Jade exists on screen and on screen only.</span>
        <span class="jade-is">Jade reflects what she sees rewarded in the online space she inhabits.</span>
        <span class="jade-is">Jade does not represent any one IRL person, but instead acts as a generalization of
            popular existing online performances of feminine identity.</span>
        <span class="jade-is">
            Jade has internalized that in her world, bigger numbers are better.

        <span class="jade-is">
            Jade is exactly who you think she is... who do you think she is? <a target="_blank"

            up with perceived demands.</span>
