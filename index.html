            <h2>ü¶ã So basically...</h2>
            <h3>This is a project about the cultivation, presentation, and monetization of self identity on the
                Internet...
                specifically on TikTok. It's a performance as a created character Jade whose narrative is left
                intentionally
                ambiguous
                because she is meant to represent a generalized version today's aspirational influencer.
            </h3>

            <h2>ü¶ã Proposal</h2>
            <p>The project was initially inspired by seeing two of my 11 year old female cousins, one on each side of my
                family, begin
                to use TikTok daily.
            </p>
            <p>
                In their posts, they would be performing the same dances to the same songs popularized by the same
                people
                that they
                idolized (most notably Charli D'Amelio and Addison Rae, the top female TikTok superstars). I watched my
                cousins‚Äô videos
                evolve from silly experiments into their own ‚Äúmorning routines‚Äù and short dance videos where they carry
                themselves in a
                way that mimics these girls with millions of followers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Seeing them internalize and reflect TikTok influencers‚Äô online personas, I started to feel compelled to
                highlight that
                this technique is one that can be learned, documented, and intentionally performed. Centered around the
                myth
                of the
                ‚Äúcute, carefree girl‚Äù turned TikTok star, I began developing an idea of a project that manifests in two
                parts:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>An ongoing (maybe one year?) digital performance on TikTok as an aspirational influencer who exists
                    online as the
                    epitome of ‚Äúcute, carefree girl‚Äù and posts one video a day that reflects the current trends</li>
                <li>A rigorous practice of archiving the performance on a custom coded, blog style website that will
                    evolve
                    as the
                    performance progresses, but will act as an archive after the performance ends</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Over the course of the workshop with Fruitful School, my goal will be to develop part two of the project
                proposal. I
                chose a hand-coded website to act as the platform for sharing the ‚Äúbehind the scenes‚Äù piece of the
                project
                because I
                want the documentation to exist completely outside of the ecosystem of social media. It should feel
                honest
                and
                accessible. It will contain information specific to each daily TikTok post as well as
                information/writing on
                the project
                as a whole. It will be linked in the TikTok profile of the created character. I plan to build it in a
                way
                that is
                relatively simple code-wise in order to increase its potential to be accessed easily in years/browsers
                to
                come. I hope
                the Fruitful School environment and curriculum would help shape how I design the website and consider
                its
                impact.

                Projects including lilmiquela, Lynn Hershman Leeson‚Äôs ‚ÄúRoberta‚Äù, Jessica Walsh/Timothy Goodman‚Äôs ‚Äú40
                days of
                dating,‚Äù
                and Amalia Ulman‚Äôs Instagram performance ‚ÄúExcellences and Perfections‚Äù have been useful references for
                developing this
                concept. I also am thinking heavily about Hannah Black‚Äôs 2013 piece ‚ÄúFurther Materials Toward a Theory
                of
                the Hot Babe.‚Äù
            </p>
            <p>
                This idea is quite WIP and I expect it to evolve, but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it, feel it is
                necessary
                that I bring
                it to life, and would love the chance to do it through Fruitful School.

                <li>Jade is working toward universal appeal, avoiding potentially divisive content</li>
