I ALMOST did not post this. I didn't even plan on making this video! But, I was in the car and I'd already filmed the video right before this, and it's really rare for me to be in the car (where there is great lighting) in NYC, but I was using it to move some stuff into my new studio space and ANYWAY I decided while stuck in traffic home from Williamsburg to film this. 

But even afterwards, I was like this is a dumb video, I've put maybe the least effort into this out of any video I have ever posted and I am barely wearing makeup, but still for some reason this Saturday morning out of boredom I came up with this caption and posted it and went for a run. 

Other girls had been using this sound to make videos like "When I see my replacement and she's ..." in a weird kind of way to compliment another girl in the abstract? I chose this specific caption because I'd previously seen other wasian girls make videos saying they wished they were "âœ¨ full asian âœ¨" and always found it slightly strange, but not in a way that I could really argue was problematic. So, went with this text HONESTLY expecting to archive it later because it would get no views. 

BUT ALAS, here we are, riding the unpredictable wave that is the TikTok algorithm, and watching this video blow up more than any other post Jade has had since this account was created on January 1st. 

I can't say exactly why this video did so much better than her others, but I think it in part is due to it using an up and coming audio and being a potentially problematic statement until you listen to the end of the clip. 

There's a lot of interesting dialogue now happening in the comments, but I'll pull out some of the highlights here: 

* @youngqimï¼š....deletes paragraph
* @rileys_filipinoï¼šwasian girls forget who gave birth to them
* @brown_noteï¼šAs another half Asian, we could make a full one.
Respectfully, madame ðŸŽ©
(and yes, I know the math doesn't work, just roll with me on this)
* @debbbbbzï¼šI was about to go off
* @getdamilkï¼šIâ€™m a good rebound guy
  * To which I replied... @jadeontheinternetï¼šThank you for your interest, will be reviewing applications and get back to you shortly!
* @chimesoffreedom1ï¼šwhite AND asian wow it donâ€™t get worse than that ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
* @coreyr2066ï¼šOkay but itâ€™s weird you just donâ€™t care because sheâ€™s asian, like thatâ€™s like almost self loathing
* @thehappyhoboï¼šWhen Hapas are just gateways to full blown yellow fever
* @brimoningï¼šIs this racist? I canâ€™t tell (this one is a personal favorite)

This post drove her follower count up by ~ 500 which finally put her over the 1K follower mark necessary to go ~ LIVE ~ !! I want to be pretty thoughtful about how I handle going live, so probably won't use the feature for a little while, but am really excited to start experimenting with it. Also, this post has me wondering: should Jade lean in to her half Asian identity? Maybe that will grow to be part of her TikTok brand. The people seem to want it.
