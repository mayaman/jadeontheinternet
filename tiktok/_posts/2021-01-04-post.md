If I am being completely honest, TikTok has already really fucked with my self esteem. When I was in high school, I struggled with my relationship with food, my body, and feeling like I always needed to put on makeup before I got to school. I obsessively thought about what I ate, would be late to homeroom because I was in the bathroom rushing to put on eyeliner and mascara, and always took it as a compliment when people commented that I looked more "white than Asian."

Now, after leaving Central Pennsylvania and growing to better understand the patriarchal white supremacist system at play, I've slowly unlearned all of those habits. But watching TikTok, all of those old insecurities come creeping back. I mean it's one thing to watch all of the hot girls on screen, but it's another to put YOURSELF out there too. When this video got basically no views after I posted it, a part of me inevitably questioned why... is it because I'm not pretty enough? Not attractive enough to catch people's attention? And then the other part of me was like okay what WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO YOURSELF.

Of course, most of the videos you see as you're scrolling are the ones that tend to go viral, so when your video flops, you feel like every attractive person on this app gets views while you don't... which, thus, in conclusion, therefore, MUST mean you're not attractive.

I think it must be hard to understand the forces at play here if you're not on the app OR you are on the app and don't have a feed like Jade's. I took two videos scrolling on her account today so you can experience what it is like: see her ["For you" page here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVfXAjG-NbI) and her ["Following" feed here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBbeI2jeuTw). I think I'll keep taking these periodically to give a sense of the type of content that she consumes daily. Made a [page to showcase them](https://whoisjadeontheinter.net/jadespov/).
