I've been thinking about how this trend is the TikTok version of the old newspaper run "[personal ads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_advertisement)" aka "[lonely hearts ads](https://www.google.com/search?q=lonely+hearts+ads&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS861US861&sxsrf=ALeKk0054gXvRa07JfuS8W2kCtw_zwVsOw:1615399088897&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj9nfTGpqbvAhWKVN8KHb4KDfsQ_AUoAXoECBAQAw&biw=1174&bih=946)." Like look at [these](https://abluteau.wordpress.com/2009/01/31/the-link-the-first-paper-for-lonely-hearts-dating-ads/)! They include age, appearance, sometimes height, and interests.

But rather than writing a letter to respond to this personal ad from Jade, all a person now has to do is hit follow and wait for a follow back confirmation to solidify their "mutuals" relationship status. Or comment, I guess, if they're hesitant to commit.

Was really hoping for ANY femme person to comment, but it's pretty much all people who appear to be masc... didn't actually follow anyone back.
