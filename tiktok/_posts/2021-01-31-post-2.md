[This girl's video](https://www.tiktok.com/@benitariley/video/6922897971356912901) titled, "POV: im that girl that gets famous for looking pretty and not knowing the dance," inspired my performance here. The silly, exaggerated faces and underwhelming dance moves are key to achieving this energy.

Was also thinking about [this girl's video](https://www.tiktok.com/@kali_rae/video/6916900050199170310), "POV: the 'popular' girl who swears shes gonna go viral." Love how in the caption of this one she points out, "Her bio says 'This is a joke' ðŸ’•" because that is the inspiration for Jade's TikTok bio, "This isn't for real." Maybe I should change it to "This is a joke" instead... could be closer to the classic stereotype?
