I recently joined [soft surplus](https://softsurpl.us/) and now have a studio space in East Williamsburg and I'm so excited to start filming Jade videos in the parking lot right outside! It's the perfect outdoor TikTok location that I didn't really have access to near where I live in Brooklyn.

Olivia Rodrigo has done it again. She recently released her second single [*deja vu*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmDBbnmKpqQ) (follow up to her mega sensation *drivers license*). 

Six days ago (from today), a girl posted [a video](https://www.tiktok.com/@stupidhoezissowack/video/6948172602103975173) of her lip syncing the song while consistently inverting the image. The effect is both disorienting and visually satisfying. When I first saw it, it took me a second to figure out what was actually happening to give the video that flashy kind of feel. 

This camera trick has become attached to Olivia's new song and today nearly every video on my fyp was of the influencers I follow participating in this trend. Sometimes [with a friend](https://www.tiktok.com/@addisonre/video/6950322398629596421). I couldn't have predicted this specific trend, but it's not surprising at all that the song immediately went viral. Like *drivers license*, it's catchy with lyrics you kind of want to scream at the top of your lungs while driving in the car with your friends with the windows down. A lot of people, including Olivia herself, see Taylor Swift as a major reference for the space in music that Olivia's currently occupying. Her songwriting style feels similar: teen girl anthems that are both hyper specific, yet extremely relatable for any young person whose ever experienced a crush or taste of heartbreak. 

Speaking of Taylor Swift, I'm actually moved seeing her music have this major comeback moment. Her re-recording of *Fearless* just dropped (which [Olivia helped promote](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9553262/taylor-swift-olivia-rodrigo-conan-gray-share-clips-fearless/)) and I find it beautiful to see so many girls finding something to connect to in her lyrics in the same way I did when I was 15. 

Even though I loved Taylor Swift growing up, I went through a phase in college where I became adamantly anti-Taylor as I watched her promote her white, skinny model friends as the pinnacle of female empowerment and fail to condemn Trump in 2016. But since that era, she's become much more political (the documentary [*Miss Americana*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/movies/taylor-swift-miss-americana-review.html) chronicles this transformation) and especially after these two 2020 album drops, my respect for her has been regained. Now, when I listen to *Fearless*, I find that I still know the words to every song and can picture exactly which boy I had a crush on in school when I first listened to it on repeat. 

I'm realizing that I used to feel guilty and like a silly GIRL for connecting so deeply to Taylor Swift songs. As I "grew up," they started to seem so mainstream... too "basic white girl" for me! (Rolling my eyes at myself.) But NOW I really feel that they are something so serious and special, these teen girl anthems written by and for someone who is young and understands the drama of being alive in that moment and knows that being "over dramatic" is the only way to truly express the heaviness of those emotions. Kind of feels like Olivia will be continuing that tradition for the next generation. I hate that I just wrote "next generation" makes me sound OLD.

Took A LOT of drafts for this one and I am including them all below just so you have a tangible understanding of the over effort and over thinking (relative to the output, obviously it's not that hard I know) that goes into producing something that I'm sure most people scrolled by in one second.
