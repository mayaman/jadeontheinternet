I actually thought it was endearing that someone cared enough about Jade's hair progress to comment this. But this person comments on almost every single one of Jade's video and lately I've been wondering if maybe they're in on the joke and read this blog?

[@gmbucc](https://www.tiktok.com/@gmbucc/?), if you're out there, let me know if you are WITH IT.

Anyway, now feels like the time to write about the saga that was me getting my hair done and spending a total of $377 all for it to end up essentially looking the same when I walked out of the salon.

First, this is not the first time I've dyed my hair. In high school, 100% inspired by tumblr, I decided to ombre my hair and then continued to do that for the next like six years. It made me feel prettier, which after college I wondered if it was because I was more BLOND aka closer to European beauty standards and farther away from looking Asian???? My very cool cousin actually wrote a piece on [the pursuit of blondness for *The Atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/08/the-pursuit-of-blondness/567688/) that I think about a lot. She uses an exhibition focusing on the phenomenon of people dying their hair blond to consider the relationship between blondness and whiteness:

> Blondness, then, exists as a complicated form of self-expression. It can signal youth, beauty, privilege, and conformity. But it can also represent rebellion, independence, and the demand to be looked at and respected.

Considering that, my inner conflict re the tension between my Asian/Whiteness as it manifests in my hair choices led me to quit dying my hair and let it all naturally grow in. And I haven't regretted it since! My hair has been really healthy and coloring your hair is an expensive and time consuming habit. But nearly every influencer has their hair dyed, especially the coolest Asian girls on TikTok. They usually have some cocktail of blond going on that grants them elevated, "I'm cooler than ur average azn girl" status. So, for Jade, I decided to give some ~ blondness ~ another try.  

When I went in, I asked for blond highlights and showed the stylist some photos of [@rachie.love](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKGAHkQF3jq/) on Instagram saying I was going for something like that. When I was looking for reference photos, I intentionally looked for examples of dyed hair on Asian girls because I think it gives me a more realistic sense of how it will look on me (and it's very difficult to narrow that search to half Asian girls on the Internet). 

I've never gotten highlights before, so I was surprised when he started asking me lots of questions: *Full or half head of highlights?* *What color toner, warm or cooler/ash?* 

I kept getting nervous and pleading for him to just do whatever he thought was best! And ended up going with a full head of highlights and choosing the ash color based on this photo and fear of my past experiences when my hair starts to turn all brassy and orange.

Oh, and I also suddenly felt inspired to get shorter bangs? (Never a great thing to feel anything suddenly while sitting in the chair in the salon.) 

Well, when all was said and done, my hair looked like [THIS](https://whoisjadeontheinter.net/badhair/). I felt like a weird cat with grey stripes. I spent the whole next day feeling upset about it and complaining to my mom that I ended up calling the salon and asking if I could come in again so they could adjust the toner and make it look less blue/silver/gray. They were really kind and said of course, so I rushed back in and they re toned it (twice! he said it needed to get all the ashiness out) and re washed it and I lef the salon with my hair wet. The stylist said he would do it for free, but I felt bad because it was extra work AND he was a queer person who grew up near where I'm from in Central PA (NOT a very liberal area), so I venmoed him another $20 as a thank you. 

But! Once I walked home and my hair had dried, as you can see in this video, it looked like I had just gotten it cut, no color, which I felt undermined the drama I was hoping for in this hair video. Okay the end. If you take away anything from this way to long post about my hair, think about how much time and energy women put into their hair. I mean this was nearly $400 AND at least 6 hours of my time in the salon. Imagine that every few months! And even though I participated, I don't even get to feel like I am expressing newfound beauty or privilege with failed blond attempt. Maybe full send all blond is the move next time... I need to start investing in crypto or something to keep up this hair habit.
