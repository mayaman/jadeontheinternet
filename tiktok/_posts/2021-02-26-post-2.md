I just finished reading [Mrs. Dalloway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs_Dalloway) by Virginia Woolf and one of my favorite lines is:

> The cold stream of visual impressions failed him now as if the eye were a cup that overflowed and let the rest run down its china walls unrecorded.

The book was first published in 1925, but that description applies so perfectly to my feelings on TikTok's endless scroll. As I move deeper and deeper into my generated For You page, my eyes very quickly feel like they are "overflowing" with content, yet I can't bring myself to look away. To get myself off the app, it always feels like a small internal part of me has to force itself up off the small couch in my brain where it is chilling and reach forward to grab my eyeballs and jerk them away from the screen back out into the offline world.

I actually filmed at least nine different drafts of this dance and the last few were totally unusable because I looked so clearly sweaty in them from doing the dance so many times in this aggressive sunlight. The one I ended up posting was my first take. So dumb, isn't it.

Reading Mrs. Dalloway (we're going to keep doing this cross comparison okay I know it might not make total sense, but I feel it just bear with me), I realized that a major theme of the book was the strangeness of performing oneself. Referring to the protagonist Clarissa Dalloway, Woolf writes:

> How much she wanted it - that people should look pleased as she came in ... half the time she did things not simply, not for themselves; but to make people think this or that.

This sentiment, nearly 100 years later, encapsulates essentially what Jade is pursuing. The moment she appears on someone's For You page is the moment she "comes in." She wants every viewer to be impressed, compelled, and yes pleased by her presence on their little screen. But simply _thinking_ "this or that" is not enough. She always wants to be compensated in the form of likes, comments, and followers for her presence. Social media platforms uniquely quantify reactions in this way.

Okay just one more Mrs. Dalloway thought. Toward the end of the story, Woolf points out Clarissa's awareness of her ex-lover's presence at the party she was hosting. She writes:

> He made her see herself; exaggerate. It was idiotic.

That's how I feel about documenting this project. This website that you're on right now is the "he" and it forces me to confront all of the unused drafts, the extra money spent, the excessive SCREEN TIME. Documenting all of it makes me see myself and Jade as one, pouring our time and energy into building a presence on an app that, when I zoom out, feels like an idiotic waste of time. At least in the way we're posting right now. Little value added or gained.
