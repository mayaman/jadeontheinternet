Everyone wants to be a protagonist. I mean why are we all out here posting on social media anyway. We all are trying to be the "main character," the one at the center of the story who everyone else pays attention to and admires (ADMIT IT).

I actually remember the first time I considered this phenomenon. It was in high school after reading a [piece by Tavi Gevinson for her publication _Rookie Mag_](https://www.rookiemag.com/2012/01/how-to-not-care-what-other-people-think-of-you/) (which, if you haven’t delved into their archives, I recommend, it saved me in many ways I think). In it she references a tumblr comment where the writer says, “most people think girls want to be skinny because of Hollywood and Vogue. This girl wanted to be skinny because she wanted to be a _protagonist_.” I think about that last bit ALL THE TIME.

People want to look like the person who plays the lead, who holds others' attention. Now, on TikTok, audio snippets like this one let everyone live out that mini movie fantasy for 15 seconds.

When I first encountered this trend where people lip sync the lines of the beautiful character in a movie, I found its overtness to be kind of embarrassing. There's not a lot of subtlety here. In this post specifically, Jade is asking her audience to see her as a sweet, object of desire. The kind of girl who would catch this boy’s eye.

I truly have no idea what the deal is with [this boy](https://www.tiktok.com/@jacksonpassaglia). He's not giving me much to work with on his profile. All I know is that he seems to have acquired millions of followers from making these kind of "POVs" where he lip syncs the lines from a movie and lots of girls duet it to make it look like they're having a conversation. This duet feature on TikTok really takes "fan girling" to another level.
