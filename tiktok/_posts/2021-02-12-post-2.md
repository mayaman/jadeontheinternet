Reading [_TikTok Face_](https://reallifemag.com/tiktok-face/) by Cat Zhang I was !!! very excited to see her articulating the various successful performance techniques adopted by popular femme creators on the app. She talks about smiling while dancing, Bella Poarch's cute faces, and Addison Rae's signature nose scrunch, but she also goes on to point out a phenomenon I find the most fascinating on this app, the embodied meme: "Their reaction is embodied, making it more personal: the attraction is not just the meme itself, but the addition of “pure” personality, enabling viewers to imagine what creators might be like off screen."

Memes rely on relatability. The ones that go viral often allow us to ourselves, our experiences, and our opinions reflected in their content. But TikTok trends like this one introduce another layer to meme making which, as Cat points out, involves personally embodying the joke. This can immediately make a meme even more compelling because we love to peek into people's personal lives and discover how they might relate to our own:

- [She's spending Valentine's day alone?](https://www.tiktok.com/@annaxsitar/video/6927465273893080325) The comment section becomes a place for people to speculate about her past relationship.
- [Bored of living the same day over again in quaraintine?](https://www.tiktok.com/@madsmartinn/video/6926901116298857734) So are the 157K+ people who liked and took the time to write about how they could relate.
- [Struggling with body dysmorphia?](https://www.tiktok.com/@fifthequeef/video/6927392155447119109) You can see not only this girl publicly open up about it, but also 7K other people in the comments expressing how they can relate. They're in there writing things like "it ain't over til my thighs stop touching" and "i'll be skinny when i have a flat stomach and the scale says 105" (together, both of these comments have over 7000 likes).

Reading the comment section on that video twists my insides because I know all of those feelings and naively thought maybe we were moving past that as a culture. But alas, TikTok trends like this hand banging one reveals both the frustrated faces behind dangerous feelings and the thousands of people who emphasize. It's next level meme culture.

Unlike Instagram, TikTok feels like an appropriate space to express ones anxieties, frustrations, and low moments. You can turn your relatable struggle into a viral, 15 second sensation starring you staring into your smartphone's front facing camera. The ability to succinctly express your personal anxiety becomes both a form social capital and community engagement. It's online success by the app's metrics, but I continue to wonder what it means for offline emotions when, for example, girls on the body dysmorphia post aren't talking about getting better, only getting skinnier.

What Jade wrote here actually vaguely references an experience I had in high school where my best friend at the time became upset that I was spending more and more time with my new (and first) boyfriend. I posted this because I felt curious what other people might advise and also wanted to introduce a narrative around talking to a boy.

One person, [user4842869040584](https://www.tiktok.com/@kernygang17) wrote, "Your friend should understand and want good for u and play if she is your best friend u guys can hang out whenever." They look like they are maybe six years old based on their profile picture, but it's honestly good advice that I wish I had when I was going through this experience at 15.
