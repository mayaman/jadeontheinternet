Every time I post a TikTok with a text overlay I fuck it up because somehow the text always manages to be covered by at least one element of the TikTok UI. In this one, it got covered up by the comment icon on the right and then also my username at the bottom. Also on Jade's profile page the little view count and play button at the bottom covers my close captioning on the cover. How are you supposed to account for all of this beforehand?! I guess you can kind of see where the icons will appear when you're moving the text around... it'll show up if your finger gets close to where the an element would eventually be located, but I think they should just always be visible so rookies like me can't keep making these mistakes! None of the big influencers seem to have this issue, so they just must have like a hyper awareness of where to put their little text boxes.
