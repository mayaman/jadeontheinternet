SooOOOoOOoO this is now Jade's most viewed TikTok ever, currently at 29.3K views as I write this on May 5, 2021. I decided to repost this version even though I had already posted [another version]({% post_url /tiktok/2021-04-27-post %}) because I wanted to see how the video would do without such a long (aka a few seconds) lead in that contained essentially the same content. This video clearly outperformed the other. 

The MAJORITY of responses argued that no, Jade and the girl on the cover do NOT look alike. Some people sniffed racism, saying people were saying that just because we were "both Asian." 

There were some alarming comments (for multiple reasons)... let me list some here:

* @woodship10ï¼šI mean if you are that person in the cover you will obviously lookalike
* @chasingtroubleï¼šno, you're way better looking
* @scott_summers2020ï¼šThat isn't you?
* @rimurutempest610ï¼šhonest opinion? You look better but I'm not trying to be rude either ðŸ¥º
* @isaacjoshiï¼šall women are the same ðŸ˜’
* @everything_is_wellï¼šShe looks like she is secretly leading a cult out of her basement...... how do I join?
* @ambussh1912ï¼šDonâ€™t say that. Thatâ€™s racist not all Asians look the same
* @cauliflowerriceï¼šliterally not at all, youâ€™re gorgeous!!! ur both pretty but like different types of pretty
* And the MOST ALARMING: @user17273747576787ï¼šmayaontheinternet on IG if you wanna ask her

!!! The person who wrote the last commented listed was like yeah that's Maya in the photo but didn't seem to realize the account was ALSO ME? Very confusing. Oh I forgot another comment from someone else I knew from school who wrote:

> @_jjflan_ï¼šthis is a funky experiment, jade ðŸ˜‰

He clearly knew what was up. I also kind of knew him. Makes me nervous to think word could get out about what I still think of as my secret TikTok project...

Okay wait also guess what, I was at a birthday picnic on Saturday and someone who I didn't know came up to me and was like "were you on the cover of the post?" Shocking right? Like I don't really remember the faces of random laypeople I see in the media, but somehow he recognized me? 

Anyway, I think this will be very funny to look back on as Jade's first 20K+ viewed video once more people maybe understand the irony...
