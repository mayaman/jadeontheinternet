After [the video I posted right before this](https://www.tiktok.com/@jadeontheinternet/video/6964450391752805637) was taken down, I posted this right after to test and see if it would pass through the system. 

It again DID say it was "under review" at first, so it wasn't showing up on my profile for others and I couldn't share it, but! eventually it posted like normal without any take down or Community Guidelines violation notification... I think this must be because I'm wearing pants and not a full bikini so its less nudity? 

BUUUUT despite the video eventually posting like "normal," I have reason to believe it was still ~shadow banned,~ meaning it wasn't hitting the For You page at all.

I think this for two reasons:
1. The view count remains extremely low compared to Jade's other surrounding videos
2. After it'd been up for a day and I looked at the analytics, it said < 1% of views were coming from the For You page. And it has less than 100 views, so that means less than one view!

I'm not sure if this happens because TikTok scanned it and decided it was showing too much skin, but not enough to warrant a take down, so the app shadow bans it instead? Or if it's because my previous video had been taken down for violating guidelines? 

Either way, again, very frustrating. Making each one of these videos takes a lot of time and to have it deprived of a fair chance to battle it out there on the For You page feels like spending a lot of time writing a text to the group chat only to have nobody respond. You feel? 

Aaaaand I know this frustration is shared by basically any other person who has put an ounce of effort into creating videos for the app. [This piece by The Markup](https://themarkup.org/working-for-an-algorithm/2021/04/22/shadow-bans-dopamine-hits-and-viral-videos-all-in-the-life-of-tiktok-creators) covers the vicious cycle of being a TikTok creator really well, more accurately than I've seen in most articles online that only care to cover the successful influencers. They talk about the mythical "shadow ban," but also focus on how exhausting the process of posting is for creators just starting out. One person they spoke to described the feeling of trying to solve the algorithm quite accurately:

> "You invest time in it because it’s this odd mystery puzzle,” Oyelowo said. “With algorithms, in theory, there is a potential solution, there is a way to figure it out—everybody is chasing that pot of gold in some way. But it’s a moving target."

So, that's me and Jade, chasing the pot of gold. * sigh * it is times like this that make me want to quit this project, so it's really wild to me that there are people out there who aren't even doing a project they are just DOING IT and dealing with this all the time. Let's all * sigh * for them jeez.
