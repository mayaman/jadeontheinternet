The first time I ever heard the word "wasian" was on TikTok. After 24 years of being wasian, I'm surprised I hadn't heard the term sooner. Looks like it was added to [Urban Dictionary in 2012](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Wasian), almost 10 years ago.

It's strange feeling like being half Chinese actually affords me some social capital now. Like it's something to be coveted. Growing up, I remember always feeling like it was a compliment when people at school told me I "didn't look that Asian" or would tell me that they "always forget" that I'm Asian. I associated looking white with looking prettier and being more desirable.

But I've felt a shift over the past couple of years. Maybe it's because I've moved farther and farther away from the small, mostly white town I grew up in. Or maybe it's because we've started to see more Asian protagonists in mainstream movies like [_To All the Boys I've Loved Before_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=555oiY9RWM4) or maybe it's because of Kpop bands like [BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdZLi9oWNZg) or the rise of contemporary "Asian Fusion" or ["Asian-American" cuisine](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/t-magazine/asian-american-cuisine.html). Being associated with these things now feels trendy, a sharp contrast from when being associated with these things made me, as a kid, feel just different.

As a privileged half white half Chinese person, the racism I have personally encountered in my life has always felt like small droplets here and there rather than a consistent downpour (as many Black/Brown or even full Asian people experience). I'd once had an adult comment to my boyfriend at the time that Asian girls were great to date because they are "obedient" or another time, when I was dating a studious white boy, a friend of his said to him, "Of course _you_ would date an Asian girl."

OR, when during the COVID-19 pandemic, on a video call hangout a friend of a friend made a joke about the virus coming from China because "they eat rats there," but he was quick to clarify that he never would have said that if someone Chinese was in the room. My boyfriend spoke up to mention that I was indeed Chinese, but I guess I was ambiguous looking enough that he had no idea. Thinking of him making that comment still makes me want to cry not just for myself, but for my greater Chinese family and what people might be saying when they're not in the room.

These kinds of moments always sting, but I always write off those people as ignorant or old school. Those kind of microagressions SUCK, but they also (perversely) validate my non-whiteness (which now is also, in certain contexts, more cool). Overall, in 2021, Jade feels confident in showing off her "wasian" looks because she knows being mixed race is now desirable, something to be celebrated. I mean, look at it girl avatar [Lil Miquela](https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/). She was literally designed to be ethnically ambiguous because it's _cool_. Of course, we all are still living in a world that tends to worship European beauty standards, but I feel this undeniable shift watching this type of trend become popular on TikTok... _wasian_ is now a feature not a bug.
