Setting the scene for a transition!!! I actually walked over to my parents apartment to drive their minivan out of the parking lot and onto the street then I parked in front of a fire hydrant so I could film it from the front seat. Nothing says I'm not in NYC yet like me sitting in the driver's seat of a car!

Felt funny filming this as if I had an audience who was paying attention to the fact that I "don't live in New York." In the references I have a video from a girl who films lots of talking to the camera style videos in her car. I often see videos from this angle in the car, I think because the lighting is so good, you're getting it from all sides. Also, you're comfortably seated so can film many videos and also shielded from the public embarrassment of filming a video.

Will write more on why I'm moving Jade to the big city soon...
