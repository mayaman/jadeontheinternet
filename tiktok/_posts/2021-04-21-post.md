I'm exploring starting to reference Jade's relationship to the greater project of [whoisjadeontheinter.net](https://whoisjadeontheinter.net/) on her TikTok profile. I'm inspired by the way that [Lil Miquela "came out" as a robot](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhwuJcmlWh8/) and [now it's part of her "brand"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bn3tUUtj2M) and everyone is down in a way that feels like they actually don't care that she has no corporeal body. That's not why people follow influencers anyway. 

Curious to see if anyone comments on the line "the intense labor of producing this digital self online indefinitely" ... I wanted to embed something semi jarring in there and was inspired by this quote from *Glitch Feminism*: 

> The production of these selves, the digital skins we develop and don online, help us understand who we are with greater nuance.

Reading that really resonated with me. It captures my motivation in enacting this performance... an effort to understand both myself and this hyper feminine wannabe influencer archetype.

\*

This trend is meant to offer insight into a person's mind via a list of what they think about most often. A lot of the references by girls I found include list items around eating/calories or are related to the labor that goes into achieving the current beauty standard: summer tan, eyelash extensions/lifts/etc, mascara, the gym, the perfect body, getting abs, [olivia pontons body](https://www.instagram.com/p/CM2lOErlfWp/), being cute, and, what I feel like was most popular, morning skinny.

Others are less concerned with that and more universal: summer, celebrities, friends, etc.

It's somewhat ironic to me that none of the lists I saw actually directly included "the Internet"  or "social media" or "TikTok" despite those things being the medium that is most responsible for delivering the listed thoughts to our brains and then also the platform we're choosing to share such observations out on to complete the cycle.

Reading back through some of *Glitch Feminism* I came across a quote that's included from Gene Mchugh where he says,

> For many people who came of age as individuals and sexual beings online, the internet is not an esoteric cornet of culture where people come to escape reality and play make-believe. It is reality.

There's no more IRL vs the Internet! The Internet *is* our new reality. Not a replacement, but rather an extension. Adding any of those things (Internet, social media, TikTok) to the list probably would just feel like adding "life" to the list. It's ubiquitous, understood to already be implied. Pointing it out would be redundant when the infrastructures responsible for sustaining us within these digital platforms have become as invisible as the air we breathe.
