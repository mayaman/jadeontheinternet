I didn't expect this to be Jade's best performing video yet. I debated a lot before posting about whether to put "hoping this lands on a rly nice _girl's fyp_" (like many girls do in the references) instead of "_person's fyp_," but ultimately went with "person's" because Jade's main audience seems to be men and she knows it and doesn't want them to feel excluded. Why? Not because she actually wants to engage with them, but solely because they contribute to her ~ numbers ~ and Jade needs whoever she can get at this point to engage with her content because she's nowhere near where she dreams to be in terms of follower or like count.

On this post, there are a LOT of just "hi" comments. Also a lot of pick up line type of comments. I genuinely wonder if people comment things like "You're gonna break my heart aren't you" and "tiktok is a dating app. hey how are u" they are expecting a response?

I did respond to some comments though because [@mucilliv](https://www.tiktok.com/@mucilliv?lang=en) commented "What's the point of posting this if u ain't gone interact with anyone" and that egged me on.

There was a bit of personal shame involved in posting this pretty overt attempt to encourage interaction with the post. [@limitedtrout617](https://www.tiktok.com/@limitedtrout617) clearly picked up on it with his comment: "jesus man, this a new low for getting simps." But Jade definitely could have stooped lower... and maybe she will if she needs to soon. Wait, does everyone know what simp means now? I remember when I FIRST got on TikTok and saw the word and felt confused. [Here's a quick history by the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/style/simp-history-slang.html) if you need it.

It is interesting to me that two of Jade's best videos have been the past two she's posted and in both of them she is wearing fake eyelashes for the first time. Curious to post another to test the correlation. Her eyes do look more bare now when I look back which kind of freaks me out because those are just... my eyes.
