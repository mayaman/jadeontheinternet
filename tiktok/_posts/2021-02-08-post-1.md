    caption: I feel like the attempt to do the TikTok lip syncing lips is more obvious in this one, but I like it less.

Okay I saw [this video](https://www.tiktok.com/@poplikethstguy/video/6921386704427388165) after filming this and it really made me laugh because I've been trying to mimic that lip thing especially based on [this girl's](https://www.tiktok.com/@kornelia.ski/video/6922564875348610310) videos she's an expert at it and the epitome of "viral for being pretty and lip syncing" kind of TikTok girl. She's gorgeous! And also seems very sweet I often look to her for Jade inspiration. The caption here also comes from one of her videos specifically where she writes "[this is my audition to join fashion tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@kornelia.ski/video/6914791298126105862)." If you are confused by what this means, basically there are different subcultures within TikTok that you can get placed within according to the algorithm's [interest over social based "sorting hat" methods](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat). People talk about being on "straight TikTok" which essentially means mainstream TikTok with big creators like Charli and Addison. But there are endless niches like beauty TikTok, LGBTQ TikTok, AltTok, BookTok, the [list goes on and on](https://www.tiktok.com/@swoov/video/6842551387406994693). I really liked [this piece by Isabel Munson](https://reallifemag.com/mirror-of-your-mind/) where she points out the conflicting desire to both "uncover" your identity and personally define it via the algorithm:

> It’s paradoxical to seek stability within platforms that incentivize flux, virality, and mimetic copying. But TikTok, and algorithmic feeds in general, make this broader contradiction seem coherent: Identity can be both stable (who you “really” are) and constantly changing (a form of “human capital” that can be accumulated and manipulated as circumstances demand).

An overt plea like the one Jade is making in this video caption reveals how tactical one can be in terms of how their video shows up, but at the same time how they are at the whim of the algorithm and how it chooses to surface your video. This feels like a good time to reiterate the fact that 61.6% of Jade's followers are male according to her analytics. This is not her ideal audience even though TikTok has decided that it is indeed one she's best fit for. This attempt to get on "fashion tiktok" is a disguised plea to the app to connect her with other womxn creators.
