This took an embarrassing number of takes (see the eight unposted drafts below). Trying to do this dance honestly gave me imposter syndrome!!!! Overtly _hot and sexy girl_ has never really been my brand. I've realized that I actively try to distance myself from implying that someone watching me on their screen should find me ~ sexy ~ in a direct way because I never want them to think I am "asking for" that attention. Historically, I've observed that being seen as obviously seeking to solely please the male gaze with your content directly relates to one being seen as ditzy/slutty/vapid (UNFAIRLY). Thanks to this phenomenon fueled by the patriarchy, I've always been scared of posting anything online (or even just acting offline) in a way that might be seen as craving sexual attention.

SO, doing this was a serious challenge for me. I had to shed my embarrassment and really consider this a performance. But, even as my boyfriend walked in and out of the room I felt a sense of shame filming something like this. The internalized sex shame runs deep dude.

The way I felt recording this actually reminded me a lot of the narrative in the movie [_Cuties_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuties), a coming of age story that I watched recently personally found to be absolutely genius, but that was also [extremely controversial](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/12/movies/cuties-netflix.html) in the US. The film was written and directed by Maïmouna Doucouré who [talks about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8dsjAoazdY) it being somewhat autobiographical and also inspired by her witnessing a real life, very sexual dance performance by 11 year old girls in France.

The film's story follows Amy, a Senegalese-French girl who lives in a traditional muslim household. At school, Amy discovers a cool all girl dance crew who are heavily influenced by popular dance routines and displays of femininity on the Internet. From those girls and access to the Internet (via a stolen smartphone), Amy begins learning how to dance, hold herself, and generally behave to be perceived as an object of desire. The scenes of her watching a dance move, trying it herself, and then rewinding the video to watch it and try it again felt like an accurate representation of me trying to learn these TikTok dances with the end goal of looking hot while doing them.

Despite my efforts, I think this video may have been blocked from appearing on the For You page based on its views/likes relative to Jade's other videos. Maybe because its dark and involves movement that I could definitely see a bot deeming ~ indecent ~ ...
