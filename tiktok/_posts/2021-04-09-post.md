When I first saw a girl do this on my FYP I was genuinely wowed it's visually pretty sick. This is a perfect TikTok ready tick. A showy, satisfying demo that can be completed in a few seconds. Watching, that is. I filmed so many drafts of this because it was hard to get the angle/camera work right and woke up today (the day after) in SERIOUS pain. My neck and back are soooooo sore. And the video barely got views! Just pain no gain for Jade...

I feel like my body was trying to tell me something while filming [this take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEDy8pHt-gA) where I got stuck at the bottom and couldn't get up lol.
