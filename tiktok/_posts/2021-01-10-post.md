There's something about this audio plus filming this from your bed that feels extra intimate. I feel like the Color Customizer makes Jade look extra spicy too, like maybe less innocent?

When I've seen some popular (white girls') accounts use this audio, the comment section often becomes essentially a debate over whether or not they said the "n" word. See [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@emmabrooksmcallister/video/6914905130022341893) where this girl re-did this video because of comments pointing out the ambiguity. Her attempt at not saying it is almost comical. Like, it's great that people are aware that is NOT COOL to mouth that, but I feel like just using this audio in general is uncomfortable... like nearly every TikTok dance trend, it's been taken from a Black creator/the Black community and rendered popular by non-Black creators.

But despite (or maybe because) of that simmering controversy, this sound became mega popular over the last few days. Girls that Jade follows often uses it to talk about something they find attractive in a guy (see references for examples). I've seen many TikToks before about insecurity derived from the number of "hot girls" that boys must be seeing on TikTok all the time. The written text on this video reflects that insecurity... actually found [this video](https://www.tiktok.com/@kimberlyggomez/video/6914858203943668997) with a similar premise.
