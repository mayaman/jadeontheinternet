My friend texted me the other day, I quote from iMessage: 

> what is this tik tok trend

> where like people squint their eyes
 
> and bite their lips

It made me laugh a lot because it put into perspective the TRUE STRANGENESS of this phenomenon, but also how strange it was that is was totally not weird to me because of how steeped in mainstream TikTok culture I have become.

This facial expression has become a kind of embodied "hey girl" style meme. [This video](https://www.tiktok.com/@emmabrooksmcallister/video/6938913373589392646) kind of spells out the vibe. It is funny and not exclusive to this sound. The face shows up all over the place.
