These types of videos are USUALLY filmed with friends, but I was with my friend at the Brooklyn Botanic gardens and she has a big following online, so we thought that might give the whole thing away if she was in it. But! I was telling her about the project and she kindly offered to film a video for me, so I figured might as well do one that's meant to be filmed from this kind of POV.

Re-watching this I am once again thinking of Coco Klockner's [piece](https://reallifemag.com/main-character-energy/) "Main Character Energy." Specifically this bit:

> It is an identification not with any character’s traits but with a set of cinematic techniques, insofar as they can be applied to you, as though you were being filmed wherever you go. The world is not a stage (as per the Shakespearean cliché) but rather “on location.”

The whole time we were in the garden, I had this nagging feeling of being "on location." It was a perfect setting for a TikTok and I was already there dressed the part. This brings me to a bit from the new Bo Burnham special I just watched on Netflix where he explains how he's been enlightened about the relationship between the physical and digital world:

> That the outside world, the non-digital world, is merely a theatrical space in which one stages and records content for the much more real, much more vital digital space.

> One should only engage with the outside world as one engages with a coal mine.

> Suit up, gather what is needed, and return to the surface.

See, that really fucked me up because he articulated exactly how I was beginning to feel all the time filming Jade videos while out in NYC. Everywhere could be the perfect location and you could ALWAYS film one more take.

Did I feel embarrassed about disrupting the peace in this gorgeous rose garden? Yes, that's why this was truly a one take operation. Was it worth it? Honestly, maybe not! Views are weak, but was fun having a friend film <3
