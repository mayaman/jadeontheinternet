I would like to just take this moment to acknowledge that Donald Trump left the White House today and I, like much of our nation, am THRILLED.

Okay anyway, I happened to be filming the other dance and saw that [@mahakhamidd](https://www.tiktok.com/@mahakhamidd) had just posted her new dance and I wanted to learn it right then and there to try to be early to it. Her choreo is always on the more challenging side (relatively), but always very fun. She has great musicality.

I always think it's funny that people post videos that are like "here this is, but I'll do it better later!!!!" (see it [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@charlidamelio/video/6811517685034142981), [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@itssissysheridan/video/6886105040105377029), and [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@lorengray/video/6887985803394338054)). I see it all the time. Given these moves were so fresh Jade definitely was feeling like this was not her best performance, so the caption reflects that.
