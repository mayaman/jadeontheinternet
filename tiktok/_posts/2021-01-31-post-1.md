This old face filter sometimes makes someone look [REALLY different](https://www.tiktok.com/@dj_turn_me_up/video/6919617882255035653) and sometimes seems to [barely affect someone's face](https://www.tiktok.com/@daily.dose.of.molly/video/6921729129855405317) at all. This is again in my "Surprise! I'm hot" category, but has a funnier twist than most of these kinds of trends.

[This one](https://www.tiktok.com/@alixzunn/video/6922511104576949509) really made me laugh. In a lot of videos in this trend people are talking about how glad they are to not be white because of how poorly the filter makes some people "age." One could also argue that the filter just works best on white faces?
