ENTER: The fake eyelashes. This is part of my greater plan to start veering Jade toward the [ABG aesthetic](https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/g5p44x/it-was-a-cultural-reset-a-short-history-of-the-abg-aesthetic) which includes big eyelashes, dyed hair, and hyper femininity.

This trend feels like a classic example of people on social media using "self love" as an vehicle to search for validation that they are loved on a platform that does not love them. Though Jade received some nice notes, [@kooladriel](https://www.tiktok.com/@kooladriel?lang=en) commented "lighting and decent facial features," implying that was all she had going for her which is slightly insulting. I just looked at his page to link that and the most recent video is him shaking his head underneath his declaration: "if u need makeup stfu" ?????

Anyyyyyyway, posting this kind of video continues to feel like a test in desirability that the TikTok algorithm and its user base are simultaneously grading. And there's a VERY unfair curve that positively benefits people who are white, thin, and able bodied, and negatively affects everyone else's chance of getting a high score.

So, is this self love or self obsession? Kind of neither. Jade's obsession isn't with herself, but instead with figuring out what _other people_ think of her. Self perception obsession maybe would be what I'd call it?
