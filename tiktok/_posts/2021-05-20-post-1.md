I was feeling a lot of insecurity before posting this video. It's the first full body bikini video Jade has ever posted and I felt nervous about what people might say or just THINK about my body when they saw it. After watching and judging my draft of this video probably at least 30 times, I finally decided to go for it and pressed share and sent it out into the ether. 

BUT THEN, although it loooooked like it had been shared, for a while (longer than normal) it was getting zero views which was unusual. I checked to see if it was actually live on Jade's profile by trying to share the post, but I was unable to, blocked by an alert at the top of my screen that said, "This video is under review and can't be shared right now." SAD. So, I waited a bit and when I went back on the app to check in was shocked to find a "System notification" that read:

> A video you posted on 2021-05-20 12:04 has been removed for violating our Community Guidelines. Please observe these guidelines to help us maintain a safe, respectful TikTok community. 

I couldn't really make sense of how this cute hot girl summer bikini look video had "violated" Community Guidelines... especially considering that when I scroll my For You page, I see SO many girls posting videos of themselves in a bikini. How were their (often, much more suggestive) videos allowed, but this one wasn't? 

Okay enter some dark UX. This action is clearly deterred by design, but if you click on this notification, it takes you to a page that gives you the option (in small font) to "appeal." Immediately after finding this path, I appealed and received a notice that my appeal had been received, but was given no expected timeline as to when I might hear back. Now, the video still appeared on Jade's profile (only visible from her account), but the thumbnail was darkened with the cut off words "Community Guidelin..." written overtop in white. If I tried to click on the video to watch it, the screen went black and let me know the video had been removed.

Frustrated with the prospect of just waiting and curious to see how this might affect my ability to post anything else on the app, I decided to post [another video](https://www.tiktok.com/@jadeontheinternet/video/6964462359632940294), the dance you see above this, to see if that one would make it through the system. I talk more about that whole experience in that post. 

This saga of this outfit change video did eventually come to an end. The next day, 19 hours after making the appeal to be exact, I received another notification labeled "Your video appeal result" that read:

> Thanks for your appeal. Our policy team has reviewed your video, and has restored it. We appreciate your patience and contributions to our community. 

Notice that this language fails to ever grant you an apology. There's no "SO sorry we took down your video and mistakenly labeled it as Adult nudity/sexual activities" it's only "We appreciate your patience." 

As a creator (okay I know I'm not a """ creator """ but you know what I mean), it's extremely draining to feel like you are simply at the whim of an algorithm that will continue to err on the side of judging you harshly. Labeling this as "Adult nudity and sexual activities" makes me feel guilty about having a body and deciding to show it. I understand why they need to screen for these things. Of course porn shouldn't be floating around on this app for any person to just scroll on by, but it felt like the system was simply screening for a certain amount of skin and nothing else. Even if the screening algorithm is too complicated to adjust for more nuance at this point, I wonder how the experience of having a video taken down might be adjusted in order to assume the blame is NOT on the person posting, but instead of the system itself? 

By simply adjusting the language, TikTok could make the whole experience feel more gentle, especially when the video reaction is being spit out by an algorithm that's prone to make mistakes. The notification could say, "your video has been removed because it *might* violate Community Guidelines" rather than the authoritative notification I received that implied it unquestionably did, with a kind of reprimand attached. 

I mean, this experience did honestly deter me from trying to ever post too many more bikini videos, so maybe it did its job...
