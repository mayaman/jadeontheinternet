This trend falls into a category of videos that I have personally labeled “surprise! I’m hot.” They always start with some suspenseful clip(s) that don’t quite reveal how the creator actually looks. But then, they end on a big reveal where the audience sees that the person filming it is indeed HOT. It surprises and satisfies. A perfect TikTok video recipe. (I feel the need to clarify I'm not trying to assert that I'm hot, but that's what Jade is definitely aiming for here.)

The key to really nailing this type of video is to make yourself look as unattractive as possible at the beginning of the video, then as attractive as possible at the end. This video formula strangely acknowledges the construction of beauty online while simultaneously reinforcing it. Here, Jade is both asserting her own attractiveness and testing it at the same time.
