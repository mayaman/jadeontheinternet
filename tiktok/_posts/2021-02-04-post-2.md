Want Jade to take more videos that feel like they were made on the fly. This one is an attempt. This is the first reveal of the very on brand phone case I bought her. It's a [Wildflower case](https://www.wildflowercases.com/) I bought via Depop. It is THE brand of phone case to have if you are an aspirational influencer girl. They have collabs with lots of influencers like [Emma Chamberlain](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC78cxCAcp7JfQPgKxYdyGrg) and [Antonio Garza](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6IWsqdKvMKjPl-gcouvoWw) (who I had never heard of, but I guess this case is from her collab). Now that you know, you will see their cases in mirror selfies everywhere.

The audio has a built in hook with an ending that unfortunately I was like this may appeal to Jade's mostly male audience. Okay goodnight.
