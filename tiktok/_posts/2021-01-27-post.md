Okay so I am going to write this lil post and decided to just for the hell of it google "asian eyelash beauty NEWS," and I find [this article](https://www.bustle.com/p/why-these-asian-women-will-never-stop-getting-eyelash-extensions-8336506) on _Bustle_ where Sara Tan, interviews different Asian woman on their committed relationship with eyelash extensions. She points out that many of the women said that because their Asian eyelashes are, without interference, "notoriously stick-straight," they feel the need to get extensions. She also points out that a majority of Asian femmes grew up mastering "tricks" for how to "make our eyes look bigger, more expressive, more 'white.'"

I found it weirdly comforting to read this because I actually got this eyelash lift for myself, not just for Jade. I was dancing in a music video and wanted to look good for it and not worry about my eyelashes staying curled during a long shoot. While making this TikTok, I was trying to personally understand my motivation for paying a not small amount of money to have my eyelashes glued up in place with weird chemicals.

I feel a sense of guilt getting this kind of salon service. Am I a bad feminist for trying to adhere to the European beauty standards for eyelashes?! Am I being manipulated by the MEDIA? Now I'm laughing because writing these thoughts out they sound kind of ridiculous, but that is honestly the conflict that circulates in my mind.

I also feel a sense of guilt posting this on Jade's TikTok. Writing this caption felt so ironic, acting like it's no big deal or even more "ethical" because it's still your "natural" lashes. Yeah, natural plus the process of shocking the hairs into defying gravity. After watching this video, I don't want anyone else to feel like they _need_ to or probably _should_ do this, especially Asian girls like me who also struggle with stick-straight eyelash insecurities. But, I also just read [this article in i-d](https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/5dpjm5/2021-year-of-the-bimbo-tiktok-feminism) about how 2021 is the "year of the bimbo" and in it one self proclaimed bimbo explains that “TikTok bimbos are anti-capitalist while at the same time recognising through this luxurious aesthetic that you can’t fully escape the bounds of capitalism as both a source of pleasure and oppression.”

So maybe I need to chill out and accept that it's okay to find pleasure and satisfaction in getting an eyelash lift while also being aware that it's kind of a habit derived from oppression? Very 2021! Kind of a relief?
