For the record, Jade is a capricorn. She was born on screen on January 01, 2021.

I have no idea how people are supposed to guess someone's sign from a 15 second video OR what signifies someone being a gemini vs capricorn vs cancer etc, but lots of people seem to use this tactic to generate comments. [Astrology is in](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/01/the-new-age-of-astrology/550034/) you know, a trend and a comfort.

Also my boyfriend sent me a screenshot of this and was like... "Jade is single?" and so I asked him if he wanted to be Jade's boyfriend and he said maybe so now I am plotting introducing that storyline : - )
