I truly had a dream last night, after thinking a lot about this comment while I was falling asleep, that some boys beat me up and ripped off my shirt while filming it in my high school hall way while taunting me by calling me Chinese.

Online, I'm used to being so shielded from this type of blatantly ignorant and racist comment because I circulate within a hyper liberal media circle. So, seeing this, I felt indignant.

At first, I thought I'd employ a kind of sassy audio, like [Fuck You by Lily Allen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTC16SQA0II). But after I kept thinking about it, I decided it would be way more exciting to actually respond in Jade's own voice. While trying to come up with what to say, the ME in me kept wanting to respond boldly and craft a response dripping with sarcasm and passive aggression that might yield applause and admiration from people who viewed it.

With that attitude, I filmed many drafts with a script I came up with (you can see two of them (tried hair up and down lol) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjOL4wP9YA8) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP9-u7llI8o)). I showed my boyfriend to ask what he thought and he wasn't really into it. He felt like Jade was overreacting to this person's dumb comment, giving it the kind of attention it was asking for. I also sent it to Chella and MaryV to ask their opinion. Chella loved it, but MaryV pointed out that for Jade to even have the language and maturity to describe how she was feeling in that moment, she would have to be pretty developed in her understanding of racism, representation, and algorithmic bias.

At this point, that isn't who Jade is to me. She's just starting out posting on the app and doesn't fully understand the greater forces at play. So, taking MaryV's advice, I refilmed a more mild response which is what I posted to her account. I also [tried another currently trending audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEoHWDPPIyc) that felt fitting, but this simple "ummm" felt closest to the way I would imagine her to react. Plus, I was inspired by [this video](https://www.tiktok.com/@lilychee/video/6905975990900526341) a girl made based on a racist comment about her looking "too asian."

Okay but THEN after all that when I finally posted the video it wasn't showing up on Jade's profile for anyone but her (looking at her page from my personal account, I couldn't see the post) and I became very frustrated that I had spent so much time thinking about how to respond and people couldn't even see it I started crying and then continued to cry even more because I was CRYING OVER A TIKTOK POST FOR MY FICTIONAL HYPER FEMME AVATAR who had been targeted by a filthy racist TikTok user [@punkazzteacher](https://www.tiktok.com/@punkazzteacher?) whose account looks like it is run by either a 13 year old or 67 year old lonely boy. Then, I also kept crying because :-( for the first time I _really_ felt, in such a visceral way, how harmful this process can be on a person's mental health. In that moment, I felt so strongly that my quality of life would dramatically improve if I just logged off TikTok forever. But alas, eventually the video DID start showing up (albeit seems like only to her followers and that it didn't reach the "For You" page?), I stopped crying after talking a walk in the snow, and Jade moves onward.
