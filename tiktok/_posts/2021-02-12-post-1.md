Her description is actually pretty on spot. Duets seem to get Jade a lot of views, but not a lot of likes or followers... probably because people are just watching the video on the right.

It's actually really cute to see all of these hapa peoples' videos dueting this girl under her sound. I'm usually never this early to post a video on a sound there's only 36 videos right now. It's actually a fun way to bring a specific community together.
