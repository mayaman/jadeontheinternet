Okay Jade and I decided we absolutely needed to archive this after nearly 24 hours had gone by with not a single comment. Part of me wants to attribute this her follower base (and probably then her target audience by the algorithm) being 61.4% male, but it did have over 100 views after I removed it, so chances are at least one girl identifying person saw it, yet declined to comment.

But anyway, the point of this post is to talk about the great phenomenon that is the instagram "hype group chats" that were floating around TikTok. Nearly every other video on my For You page was a girl posting a video of herself (not unusual) with text overtop saying something along the lines of "I'm making a big instagram group chat where we hype each other up! Comment your @ if you want to join." Then, hundreds of girls would comment their instagram handle in hopes of increasing their following, likes, and comments.

Highly recommend clicking through the references so you get what I mean.
