So turns out my cousin's girlfriend works for Halsey's new makeup line [about-face](https://aboutface.com/) and offered to send Chella, MaryV, and I makeup from the company. I was expecting a small little pouch with a few products, but no, they sent a whole huge box with at least 25 different items PLUS a screen that was playing a little teaser for their campaign. I don't have the online presence (on my own account or Jade's) that would yield this kind of influencer beauty gift, so this is a very special treat and very useful for Jade's development because I remain reluctant to spend and exorbitant amount of money on makeup products.

I went over to Chella and MaryV's this fine superbowl Sunday to hang out with them plus our friend Julia who was staying there for the weekend. Julia knows way more about makeup than I ever will, so she agreed to do Jade's makeup for a fun little shoot. Our inspiration for this look was a combination of TikTok beauty queen Loren Gray's makeup in [this photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFNQXh7B1hh/) plus Bella Hadid's [signature](https://www.instagram.com/p/BvNHqllgNGx/) [slicked back](https://www.instagram.com/p/B50oDChgTNq/) [hairstyle](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7P5ExRg8WI/).

The getting ready part was really fun! It reminded me a lot of growing up and putting on makeup/doing my hair with my friends in our bathrooms at home while listening to music and getting ready for a school dance or for nothing just for fun. The filming part is much more stressful though. Luckily, this transition wasn't too hard to line up (I feel very proud of its accuracy) because I kept my phone set up on a MaryV's tripod for both the before and after.

I actually tried to attempt a different transition that involved the thing where you jump up and come down in a new outfit and honestly could not pull it off I need to study it more before attempting again it is harder than it looks let me tell you.

Anyway, watching this back, I'm reminded of the piece [Glow Aesthetics](https://reallifemag.com/glow-aesthetics/) (which I've mentioned before) by Dalia Barghouty. Specifically, I'm thinking about her musings around highlighter:

> Makeup then works as not a tool of artifice but a way to manifest our being on and in relation to our camera lens, our screen, and ourselves.

Jade isn't trying to hide what she looks like without all of this stuff on her face. Kind of the opposite. She's putting herself sans any makeup right in front of you, but is also making sure to juxtapose that with her aspirational final form. Which part of this video is the "real" Jade? Both and neither. She's a multidimensial being and acknowledges that in these kind of videos. But! At the same time, the second half of this video represents the kind of online presence she feels she needs to manifest as on screen. She would never allow herself to stay stuck looking the way that she looks in the first half for an entire video. The camera lens acts as a portal and a catalyst, pushing Jade from her "before" state into her "after" for other people on their screens in other places to see.
