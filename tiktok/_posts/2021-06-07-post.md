WATCH THE REFERENCES and this will make a lot more sense. I think I could have done a better job with better footage, but it's kind of hard to stage leaving a suburban home and moving to NYC when you already live in NYC. These clips got the job done.

I put water on my face from the sink to make myself look like I had been crying in the first clip. The other day I actually was crying because I missed a dance class because the trains stopped running during a rainstorm and I felt so sad about it I came home and cried and then thought now would be a good time to film the opening for this Jade TikTok, but the process of trying to film it was so annoying and required so much external attention that I quickly stopped crying and then the whole effort to film was pointless.

SO, I ended up filming the clip I actually used later. It required me running from the bathroom sink to the bed to make sure the water didn't dry/roll off. It's fake news! Never believe what you see online, kids!
