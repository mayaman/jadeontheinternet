Felt VERY awkward filming this outside while some parents were pushing their kids on some swings in the park nearby. At first tried to employ my [boyfriend to film a video of me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqEHOYDuc5M), but I hated how I looked in it and was just embarrassed by the whole exercise so I let him go and stayed around to film it this selfie way instead.
