Okay... this is a very binary and limiting view of the world and feminine identity??? This trend actually did surprise me with its non subtle reverence for unrealistic (and I mean truly, we're talking dolls and mythical creatures) beauty standards. 

Did a quick google image search on each of these categories (I recommend you do the same, you can click these links): [bratz](https://www.google.com/search?q=bratz&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS861US861&sxsrf=ALeKk02o_wsmNP6-hBnVdOmbMhh4PpXnRQ:1616959526765&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwie09XR29PvAhVMJt8KHR3TDUsQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1374&bih=830), [barbie](https://www.google.com/search?q=barbie&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS861US861&sxsrf=ALeKk03oBl8qjfTdRz7G87JWj0UNO6b4EA:1616959700454&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiF2r6k3NPvAhXhkOAKHW4eA_wQ_AUoA3oECAEQBQ&biw=1374&bih=830), and [fairy](https://www.google.com/search?q=fairy&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS861US861&sxsrf=ALeKk01LmXXQIHmYYv13FzbSw3xaQu59EA:1616959561858&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjoubPi29PvAhWwneAKHTIzDR4Q_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1374&bih=830). The search results overwhelmingly return images of dolls, drawings, and avatars that are white (with the exception of the bratz dolls which are mostly non-white), super skinny, and unreasonably wide eyed.  

Jade fits into many European centric beauty standards (she's light skinned, thin, and has Asian/White textured hair), so she carries a lot of privilege in feeling comfortable participating in this trend. One person commented that she kind of looks like [Jade the Bratz doll](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/24/e0/e5/24e0e5e52443b8c3363b02a3ac78bf50.jpg) (this is a stretch, but she is the only (kind of?) Asian representation I've seen across all three category searches). But the vast majority of girls will not be able to identify with ANY of these categories. I don't see any disabled, fat, or dark-skin representation here so who started this RUMOR that "all girls" are one of these things.

Already, I could see someone arguing that I'm being oversensitive here saying something like it's not about the loooooooks it's about the energyyyyyy and I am annoyed by this hypothetical argument because of course it's about the looks what else do you have to go off of from this nine second TikTok video.
