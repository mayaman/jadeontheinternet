Before we get to actual topic of this post, let me just say up front that this post went through the same "under review" process as [this post]({% post_url /tiktok/2021-05-20-post-2 %}) and I can see now from the analytics that it was shadow banned and didn't hit the For You page... obviously because I'm in a bikini, but something to note because it's pretty explicitly about "body positivity" and having a "healthy" relationship with your body... but let's get into that...

Something I've heard [again](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/it-s-not-worth-it-young-women-how-tiktok-has-n1234193) and [again](https://twitter.com/sissysheridan/status/1261075790168576000) and [again](https://www.thebardvark.com/articles/tiktoks-body-image-problem) from femme people who start scrolling TikTok is how negatively it affects their body image. The ultra thin girls who fit the mainstream beauty standards get the most likes/views/comments and thus their videos are pushed to the most people. But even beyond that, *The Intercept* [previously reported](https://theintercept.com/2020/03/16/tiktok-app-moderators-users-discrimination/) that TikTok was explicitly instructing moderators to suppress videos from people with “Abnormal body shape,” “ugly facial looks,” dwarfism, and “obvious beer belly,” “too many wrinkles,” “eye disorders,” and many other “low quality” traits. TikTok claims to have done away with those tactics, but who really knows, right? All I DO know is that scrolling TikTok I almost exclusively see skinny, pretty girls. 

If you're in the same world of TikTok that I'm in, you might be thinking... wait! It's not ALL so bad. There are some creators who have made a clear effort to contribute a more positive message on the app, like [@brittanilancaster](https://www.tiktok.com/@brittanilancaster/video/6947152239744109829) and (well eeeee now v controversial) [@siennamae](https://www.tiktok.com/@siennamae/video/6861428249403182342). While some of the content I've seen from both of them does feel really valuable as it's coming from someone who is not a size 00, they're also probably not larger than a size 4/6/8 and don't represent what many fat women look like. I like this point made by Rebecca Jennings in *Vox* [in her piece](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22226997/body-positivity-instagram-tiktok-fatphobia-social-media) that talks about the paradox of online "body positivity": 

> Still, that a woman proudly showing her size 4, or 6, or 8 body feels remotely radical when the average American woman wears a size 16 is a hugely depressing referendum on the state of body diversity in media. And for some creators, too much of this type of body-positive content only reinforces what kinds of people get to feel confident in their bodies and be praised for it.

Who gets to be visible when promoting "body positivity?" My TikTok algorithm often seems to answer: Skinny white creators when they decide that the body positive movement is their place to shine. For example, there was a trend going around in late 2020 where creators were putting a montage of them in skimpy clothes (not inherently bad, but in the body positivity context I feel it is not their place to take up space) and were calling their participation part of the "body positvity trend" (see [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@madi/video/6898437144050666758) and [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@itssissysheridan/video/6898527731433164038)). There is nothing radical or even remotely helpful about seeing another super skinny white girl uploading a photo of herself in a bikini and declaring body positivity and going viral and pushing other voices further from the center of the conversation.

All of this is to say, that although Jade has a seemingly innocuous, positive message here, I would argue that this video might actually do more harm than good. I'm skinny (I mean my body is not like hot athletic model material I KNOW, but I want to acknowledge that I am thin) and half white and have pretty privilege as [defined by Janet Mock](https://www.allure.com/story/pretty-privilege) as "being thin, white, able-bodied, and cis, and the closer you are to those ideals, the more often you will be labeled pretty — and benefit from that prettiness."

The "body positivity" movement originated as a radical fat activist movement led by big women, especially Black and Brown/Queer big women, but their voices are now getting lost in the conversation around "body positivity" as it's become an excuse for small/medium people to show off their figures. [Lizzo sums it up nicely here.](https://www.tiktok.com/@lizzo/video/6948850681293917446) 

Maybe it's good this post didn't hit the FYP...
