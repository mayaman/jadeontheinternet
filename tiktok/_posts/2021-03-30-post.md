This photo of me is from 7th grade. Deep side part, braces, awkward smile... can you tell that [PEN15](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8324422/) spoke to me? This is middle school as I, for the most part, relatively privately experienced it. By that I mean, I wasn't looking like this and blasting myself onto the Internet as many middle schoolers now are able to do.

One person, [@zaddymoose](https://www.tiktok.com/@zaddymoose) with no uploads and 21 followers, commented on this video "ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ Whoâ€™s gonna tell her?" and that comment plagued me all morning today because I was legitimately, in my head, like WHAT tell me WHAT AM I STILL UGLY?! Can you tell I don't know how to put on false eyelashes?! WHAT. 

It baffles me that here I am doing this whole project around the toxicity of putting yourself online and thinking critically about the consequences and whatever and I am still personally affected by a comment like this. [: - )](https://media.giphy.com/media/8cDPBzcTRwwHbW6WwE/giphy.gif)
