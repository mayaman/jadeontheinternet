I've always found there to be something deeply comforting about giving up control over decision making and leaving things to chance. This is why I love listening to the radio on a long car ride. It alleviates me of any responsibility over choosing a song, so I can relax and enjoy whatever comes on (it also does help that I have been exclusively listening to pop music lately).

There's also something comforting about being in the reverse position as well: making a decision for a stranger gives you a sense of control without fear of the consequences. 

This TikTok combines both of these urges. By having Jade place the future of her hair in the hands of her TikTok audience, she's giving up control and gifting it to her followers. 

Not as many people responded to this post as I'd hoped, but I would say that the majority of people suggested option one which is blond highlights. 

This whole exercise touches on a phenomenon that's emerging within the ~ creator economy ~ that capitalizes on the public's desire to participate in the life of those they follow online. This desire has proven so strong that people are actually willing to pay REAL money for the chance to have a stake in popular creator's day to day decisions. 

Taylor Lorenz covers this new way for creators to make money in her piece "[For Creators, Everything Is for Sale](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/10/style/creators-selling-selves.html)" in the *New York Times*. The article focus on a new platform called [NewNew](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/10/style/creators-selling-selves.html), an LA-based startup that refers to itself as the "Control My Life App." The way she describes the interaction immediately reminded me of how a younger version of me might feel about playing Sims: 

> For example, a creator can use NewNew to post a poll asking which sweater they should wear today, or who they should hang out with and where they should go. Fans purchase voting power on NewNewâ€™s platform to participate in the polls, and with enough voting power, they get to watch their favorite influencer live out their wishes, like a real life choose-your-own-adventure game.

The gap between life on screen and off is continually diminishing. Even if we're not actually living in a simulation (I still like to entertain the idea we might be though okay), apps like NewNew that capitalize on our obsession with connecting with people we only have ever seen on screen push us toward turning this world into a kind of playable, monetized simulation of its own.

The chance to control a person you follow online, but have never met or seen offline truly feels like viewing them as an avatar rather than a "real person." This brings us back to the question: What is the real difference between [Miquela](https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela) and a human influencer? From the perspective of a follower, I would argue there is virtually none.
