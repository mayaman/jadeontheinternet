Hate to admit this, but the past few days I felt soooooo tempted to just restart this project again. I wanted Jade to form a new self, because she hated her current one. If you check out my previous post (on this website not on her TikTok profile because it has been put on private due to an embarrassing zero person response), I (both Jade and I, really) was so ashamed of the lack of views and attention she was getting in comparison to all of the other accounts on my feed that I felt sure I must be doing something wrong. Nearly every girl that shows up on my "For You" page has over 1K followers (that seems like they've acquired within minutes of simply breathing on the app) and multiple viral videos that it looks like have helped them get there.

I watched the movie _Fake Famous_ last night because it was up there as the hero image on HBO Max's homepage and I was like... is this about a different kind of Jade project?! Well, turns out it kind of was, but in this horrible way from an old white man's perspective who thinks that the best way to demonstrate achieving the current definition of "influencer" is by taking photos at a fake Four Seasons and constantly buying these random millennials thousands of followers and likes.

They interviewed no actual influencers on the show except for this one woman who runs the account [@newyorkcity](https://www.instagram.com/newyorkcity/) on Instagram and clearly only has a following because she happens to have the clean handle @newyorkcity her content is terrible. [This article](https://time.com/5935454/fake-famous-review-hbo/) in Time captured a lot of my frustration. The doc was lazy and extremely behind the times (counted not a SINGLE mention of TikTok and it was released a few days ago in 2021?!).

What gets me most about these kinds of docs (I'm also talking [The Social Dilemma](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11464826/) and [Social Animals](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7969042/)) is that they are ALL directed by men and ALL are attempting to highlight, at least in part, the toxicity of social media/aspirational influencer culture and how it affects young girls. I am WAITING for a thoughtful documentary that does not feel like it's a scientific experiment directed by and directed at parents, but instead actually made by and for the people who are exposed to and engaging with this slice of the digital world every day.

Okay that's my rant for now. All of this does relate to this post I promise because in the _Fake Famous_ doc they have this one scene where one of their casted fake influencers is stressing out after posting an instagram photo and saying how anxious it makes him when he doesn't get the views/likes that he had hoped. I know, duh, like this is not a groundbreaking finding here, but I was really feeling that after Jade's recent few posts. It's funny, I don't feel it at all about any of my own TikTok posts under my own name, but with Jade, who is clearly looking for attention and not getting it, a deeper sense of anxiety emerges. Working on this project, I have felt the most stressed and anxious that I have felt all of quarantine. Looking at those small numbers on her page, I keep feeling it's both an artistic failure and simply a failure of existence. TikTok's algorithm has deemed Jade unworthy of attention, while everyone she sees on her feed seems to be blessed with worth. Of course, the people that are on her feed are the people TikTok pushes out to more viewers. We rarely see the people whose view counts stay low which makes the relativity of it all difficult to grasp. Jade compares herself to what she sees, how could compare herself to anything else?
