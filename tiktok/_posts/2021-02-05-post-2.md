Very BASIC description for a boy and I am very embarrassed by it... This one girl captioned [her video](https://www.tiktok.com/@urbfsbitch/video/6913781979016072454) that inspired this one "the bar is so low" and like for real is she right.

I decided I need to take a break from TikTok for the next 24 hours. I feel like it's colonized my brain. The bite sized sounds run rampant around my mind and in any given moment my brain starts trying to come up with video ideas. I even dream about TikTok views. It's exhausting.
