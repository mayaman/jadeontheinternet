I want to use this opportunity to write an ode to the classic SITTING IN THE CAR TIKTOK.

All of the references on this post are of videos that exemplify this phenomenon I am referencing. 

> Oh car tiktok, filmed in the front seat, 

> With light from all angles, my face looks so sweet.

> Proves that I do things, I'm a girl on the go

> If you see me going somewhere, maybe you'll follow ; - )

> The car might be moving or just in the driveway

> As I film 800 of drafts, for my single post today

> If there are others aboard, they might show up on screen,

> Perform for the shot, I beg, so my video gets seen!

> Alone or together, the video is composed,

> In a way that I hope makes sure those who watch know,

> I'm a fun car tok girl, who can film on the fly,

> And make people stop and stare as they scroll on by.

I know, I am unhinged. Should Jade release a book of poetry?
