The most effective version of this kind of video is when the difference between the first impression and last image is drastic. I tried to make myself look extra strange in the beginning to emphasize the contrast, but the whole thing just ended up looking overly try hard because of it imo.

This "Face Zoom" effect is most famously used by [Bella Poarch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rECUkcBL-DA), who became big on TikTok for her animated facial expressions. She (at one point, can't say for sure now) had the [most liked TikTok of all time](https://www.tiktok.com/@bellapoarch/video/6862153058223197445?refer=embed) with over 45 million likes.
