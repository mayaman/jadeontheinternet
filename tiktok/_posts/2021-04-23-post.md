@krissowat, if you are reading this, thank you for your comment!!!! 

This is the first instance (besides a question someone already submitted to Jade's Q&A feature on her profile bc that's harder to see) that someone has publicly commented that they've looked up and read this blog. It's written in Jade's bio, but not clickable, so I always assumed most people would not take the time to actually type the URL into their browser.

OH WAIT I definitely want to write something later re Presentation of Self in Everyday Life and mismatch impressions will come back to this...
