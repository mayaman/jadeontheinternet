So usually, I feel like there's one MAIN dance that emerges to a song on TikTok, but a lot of times there's also a lot of smaller dances that are pushed by their creators, but don't get as big as the main one. I wanted to demo the two dances floating around to the latest Doja Cat x SZA collab song [Kiss Me More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EVVKs6DQLo) which was obviously destined to be a TikTok smash.

This one is by two big creators @zoifishh @cassidycondiee known for their colorful very LA dance videos.

Also, the caption is only partially true. It was an older woman who walked by and gave me a thumbs up not a boy, but I thought saying it's a boy might be more exciting lol.
