At this point, Jade's posting just for fun. Her last video got more views than she expected, but she still feels pretty chill about the whole TikTok thing.

I kept misspeaking the lyrics, wanting to say "we're smashing LIKES at karaoke bars" which may reveal some deeper issues... but eventually got it right. Keeping things light out here on the back deck. Very homemade production.

If you look at the drafts you can see I tried a few different settings and got way to cheesy with the lip gloss. This video won out because it felt like a good balance of carefree/good lighting.
