Okay now I have also started following Kate Glavan's friend and co-podcast host [@emmaroepke](https://www.tiktok.com/@emmaroepke?) who is coming in hot onto the TikTok scene with an alt variation on the NYC girl energy I [wrote about]({% post_url /tiktok/2021-06-10-post %}) before. Her videos are more dimly lit with an explicitly negative energy. She jokes about "[tweaking out on coffee](https://www.tiktok.com/@emmaroepke/video/6973278363364445446)" and "[only having one friend](https://www.tiktok.com/@emmaroepke/video/6971590689582861573)" and [spiralling](https://www.tiktok.com/@emmaroepke/video/6973630341445586182)... 

OKay WAIT though now as I am writing this I have this worry that these girls would read this and think like she is being mean and tearing us down for what and I really just want to say ON THE RECORD I do not think what these girls are doing and posting is bad and I am not trying to hate!!!! I just am so fascinated by digital femme culture and it's important to me to unpack what and how we put ourselves on screen as modern day womxn! 

Cool, we are on the same page now. This morning, I wanted to channel this kind of "ugh I am a sad quirky girl in NYC" energy with a morning coffee video that implied I had nothing to look forward to BUT that very moment. The video got a decent amount of responses, my favorite being from [@wtfjenny](https://www.tiktok.com/@wtfjenny?) who wrote: "coffee drinkers think theyâ€™re the most quirky people ever." This is what I was going for! 

There's an art to creating a TikTok that feels intimate and casual even though you DID think it through beforehand. I recently watched Bo Burnham's special on Netflix called *Inside* and I'm thinking specifically about this line in [Richard Brody's review](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/bo-burnham-and-the-possibilities-of-the-cinematic-selfie) where he points out that the film "provides the illusion of being a documentary-like record of its own production, but in the end it is merely a polished product of its own production." In the film, Burham continually intersperses "behind the scenes" shots that are meant to show what's happening in between his filmed musical performances. But as Brody points out, these moments are just as constructed as the polished performance shots. There is no authentic way to capture one's self to be viewed on screen by the public without producing the shot in some way... For example, I switched my coffee from my usual Fuel coffee mug that I use every morning that's my boyfriend's and put it in this more Jade style ceramic mug that was made by a friend of mine... small detail, but produced nonetheless. 

These moments that people put on TikTok to appear "real" and "chill" are the most psychotic in my opinion because at least in the over produced videos effort is implied and assumed. With these "hey I just woke up!" kind of videos people imply that their goal is to bring more of the "real world" onto screen by being "real" #nofilter... but the idea of translating your physical self to the screen automatically forces you to filter yourself SO much. I would really love to hear someone to talk about that while sipping their cup of coffee in the morning. Like "Hey besties! This is the 5th time I've tried to film this little joke this morning and my coffee is actually now already cold! Have a great day!"
