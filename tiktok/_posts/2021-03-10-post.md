About a week ago I started seeing soooooo many TikToks of girls trying out [Madison Beer's Vogue makeup tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K_CZizKdVs) (pls check out some of the reference videos). Vogue has put out lots of tutorials from major starts like [Kendall Jenner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYS3UZFPJWI), [Addison Rae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxUfLP8kYss), and [Emma Chamberlain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7wTe5SRRsw), but this one in particular [really took off on TikTok](https://www.thethings.com/fans-turn-madison-beers-makeup-routine-into-viral-tiktok-trend/) as one to try out. Maybe I just missed out on the other videos OR this one has specific appeal because Madison Beer infamous for being pretty... There's been lots of controversy over her complaints of [only being seen for her looks](https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/madison-beer-says-she-isnt-taken-seriously-because-of-her-looks/) and not her music.

This video took me about 45 minutes just to film (and probably another half an hour at LEAST to edit)... it was hard to decide the best use of time and how to toggle between her on screen and me repeating her actions. I used none of the same products she was using because I don't own any of the same stuff and I had to skip some things like contour/bronzer/a face roller (???) because I don't have it. But, despite these deviations, I actually was impressed by how this transformed my face? The eyeliner on the inner part of the eye is an interesting tactic. And the heavy blush. I also added fake eyelashes as Jade does these days. Really felt like a different person at the end. Maybe that is how Madison Beer feels all the time?

The beauty filter plus the TikTok original filter comes on at the end which helps add to the drama of the transformation. This all took so much time to film that I had to end up going to my OBGYN appointment all dressed up like this fake eyelashes and all and it was my first time meeting this new doctor and the whole time I was stressed she was judging me for my makeup which was strange to observe... as she answered my questions her tone felt kind of patronizing and I was like is it my makeup or her personality? Unclear.
