Of all the Jade videos I've shared so far, this one was the hardest for me to post.

Still to this day, at 24 years old, I'll sometimes get out of the shower, look in the mirror, and wonder if I have a thigh gap (?!?!?!!), a phenomenon I first discovered had a name [on tumblr](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/news/a18504/stop-thigh-gap/) and solidified itself in my mind as a clear, measurable beauty ideal that I should aspire to. Writing that kind of makes me want to throw up.

In high school, tumblr was my gateway to discovering "thinspo" which is [basically pro-eating disorder content](https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/05/an-epidemic-basically-a-conflicted-weight-loss-blogger-on-thinspo/275671/). Although I never was diagnosed with an eating disorder and never become so obsessive I think I needed an intervention, I absolutely had a bad relationship with food and that was absolutely onset by my habit of seeking out the kind of tumblr girl imagery that featured skinny girls in high socks and short shorts floating around making life look like the easiest thing in the world.

But on TikTok, these images operate differently. I don't have to actively indicate I'm interested in this kind of content with a search, follow, or like. If I simply watch a video about what I eat in a day or how to lose weight or someone declaring their obsession with "being skinny," TikTok will note that as an interest of mine and start feeding me more videos like that.

This issue hasn't gone totally unnoticed... Last year some [articles came out](https://www.buzzfeed.com/cameronwilson/tiktok-eating-disorder-videos-algorithm-for-you-page) [highlighting the problem](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/07/tiktok-investigating-videos-promoting-starvation-and-anorexia) and recently [the Verge published a piece](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292166/tiktok-eating-disorder-support-resources-hashtags) on TikTok's efforts to surface ED support resources to counter misinformation.

Sure, those official resources surfaced by the platform are important, but it doesn't change the fact that the most compelling feature of the app, the _content_ continues to nudge people toward unhealthy ways of thinking about food and their body.

There are some creators on the app actively trying to promote body positivity, most notably (in terms of visibility) [Sienna Mae](https://www.tiktok.com/@siennamae?lang=en) who went viral for posting [a video with her stomach visibly out](https://www.tiktok.com/@siennamae/video/6861428249403182342). She consistently posts videos where she [encourages her audience to eat](https://www.tiktok.com/@siennamae/video/6908002327639117062), reminds them that "[ur weight does not define you](https://www.tiktok.com/@siennamae/video/6911470133642890501)," and that [bodies look different at all angles](https://www.tiktok.com/@siennamae/video/6895099539095686405).

Her work stands out in a sea of XXS girls' content, but she still isn't that far outside the current standard of beauty ideal. But she is the only Hype House scale creator I can think of that makes this kind of healthy content. Despite her efforts (and the efforts of many smaller creators too), as you can see in the references for this Jade video, the obsession with being thin prevails because the algorithm reinforces that being skinny matters.

Two references here. First, one I've mentioned before from [a Rookie Mag article](https://www.rookiemag.com/2012/01/how-to-not-care-what-other-people-think-of-you/) by Tavi Gevinson:

> ...most people think girls want to be skinny because of Hollywood and Vogue. This girl wanted to be skinny because she wanted to be a _protagonist_.

Then also, this thought via Jia Tolentino's _Trick Mirror_ where she points out that the focus has recently been around accepting every body as beautiful and proposes that maybe we should actually be considering the opposite:

> We have hardly tried to imagine what it might look like if our culture could do the opposite--de-escalate the situation, make beauty matter _less_.

I appreciate the sentiment, but this honestly (unfortunately) feels like an impossible task when our culture revolves around reverence for beauty according to current standards. And, as Tavi points out, people want to live out the role of the [_main character_](https://reallifemag.com/main-character-energy/) (more on that later), who is always always always skinny.

Okay all of this RANTING is to say that yes, sure, pop up ED support resources surfaced on TikTok are better than nothing, but how is any scroller supposed to pay attention to those boring looking, dismissable text boxes when the app's organic content remains compelling and glossy while whispering _Don't you wish you looked as hot as this girl?! Well obsessing over your eating habits, body shape, and weight might be for you! All you have to do to get started you have already done. Just keep watching and scrolling..._ And so we all do. And when we're not scrolling what are we thinking about? Turns out, according to this trend, a lot of people are thinking about this.
