I saw a video once of some girl explaining how she uses it and everyone seems to like the red setting plus selecting the "fifth dot" of saturation. That's what I did here and at first when I put it on I was like WOAH that's way too much but now watching it back it doesn't look too wild I don't think. People are used to seeing videos filtered like this.

This dance is cute but it's one of those trends where I think if aliens ever come to earth and find these artifacts they will be very confused by what it offers.
