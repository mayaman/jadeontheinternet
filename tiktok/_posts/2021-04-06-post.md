I watched [this tutorial](https://www.tiktok.com/@jillian_dearwater/video/6945918435272445189) before filming because even watching these videos I knew I would struggle to make something nearly as clean as some of the girls' stuff in these references. 

Yesterday, I read this piece my cousin sent me, "[The Beauty of 78.5 Million Followers](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/magazine/addison-rae-beauty-industry.html)" about Addison Rae and the new role she and other influencers like her are playing in the beauty industry. I was glad to see it pointed out the significance of the potential for seemingly anyone to produce in addition to consume glossy content on a social media platform: 

> All of us, including Rae, can really envy the gorgeous influencers on our feeds in a way we might not have envied past models like Christy Turlington, who was made of different stuff, untouchable. What’s more, we never had to put photographs of ourselves out there for public consumption. There’s a tremendous amount of anxiety generated by the fact that we do all this now in proximity with people who do it much better and whose lives seem, albeit artificially, within reach.
