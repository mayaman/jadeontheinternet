I watched [this tutorial](https://www.tiktok.com/@jillian_dearwater/video/6945918435272445189) before filming because even watching these videos I knew I would struggle to make something nearly as clean as some of the girls' stuff in these references.

Yesterday, I read this piece my cousin sent me, "[The Beauty of 78.5 Million Followers](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/magazine/addison-rae-beauty-industry.html)" about Addison Rae and the new role she and other influencers like her are playing in the beauty industry. I was glad to see it pointed out the significance of the potential for seemingly anyone to produce in addition to consume glossy content on a social media platform: 

> All of us, including Rae, can really envy the gorgeous influencers on our feeds in a way we might not have envied past models like Christy Turlington, who was made of different stuff, untouchable. What’s more, we never had to put photographs of ourselves out there for public consumption. There’s a tremendous amount of anxiety generated by the fact that we do all this now in proximity with people who do it much better and whose lives seem, albeit artificially, within reach.

This neatly captures the danger of this new cycle of not only consumption, but production that social media encourages. Especially on an app like TikTok where girl next door Addison Rae can skyrocket to beauty mogul level stardom... it's easy to wonder, as you sit at home filming dance videos in your bedroom as she once did in her humble beginnings, "why couldn't I?" 

Of course, this mindset results in perpetuating the vicious cycle of putting yourself out there for public consumption (and judgement) => dissatisfaction with the scale or kind of resulting feedback => insecurity about your face/body/clothes/existence => increased likelihood to spend money on things that promise to improve your face/body/clothes/existence and *even* your self esteem => putting yourself out there again to show off these new things with new hope........ you get the idea. 

My favorite thread in this article was the one around the beauty industry's strategic use of the very ~ trendy ~ self love/empowerment narrative. Addison talking about makeup captures the paradox perfectly: 

> “It’s another form of painting, and you’re doing it on your skin. I think you should for sure work on enhancing your own features and embracing that if there’s a flaw in you, it’s something that sets you apart from other people. Maybe it’s not even a flaw, it’s just something you think is a flaw, but it’s really part of who you are and makes you different.”

She's declaring, beauty isn't about erasing what makes you different (aka what makes you not look like Addison Rae), but instead enhancing what makes you different! The beauty industry loooooooves to tell that story. But that feels in direct conflict with her brand item beauty's true visual and copy strategy, which showcases mostly glossy perfect photos of Addison advertising products like Powder Hour which is described [on the site](https://www.itembeauty.com/collections/all/products/powder-hour) as a translucent blurring powder that is "pretty much a filter IRL".

\* 

For the most part, these kind of transition videos serve not to advertise the "uniqueness of my personal flaws," but instead how well I can cover them up. In these type of trends, everyone starts out looking pretty different, but then ends up trying to achieve the same wow factor at the end with perfect skin, well done hair, and never ending eyelashes. Basically, as Grigoriadis concludes in [her article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/magazine/addison-rae-beauty-industry.html), maintaining "a dialectic of confidence-building and -destroying, kept afloat by hyperreal images on our phones."
