Before I even watched the [Framing Britney NYT documentary](https://www.nytimes.com/article/framing-britney-spears.html), I first read [this piece](https://www.thecut.com/2021/02/tavi-gevinson-britney-spears-was-never-in-control.html) by Tavi Gevinson where she asks: _Why did I ever believe a teen girl could hold all the power?_

The naïveté implied in this question hit me hard. I initially conceptualized this project as a way to emphasize that the teen girls who are ruling the TikTok scene weren't fragile, ignorant, or ditzy, but instead strong, intelligent, and tactical while working within a system that was never built to empower them. But after becoming Jade on screen for nearly two months, I've realized that yes, these girls are in many ways strong, intelligent, and tactical, but also at the same time they are victim to a system that's online power structures mirror (honestly, exacerbate) the prejudices that poison our offline world.

In the same article, after pointing out that _Framing Britney_ storytellers seem to be trying to re-write history to turn Britney Spears into a kind of owning her sexuality at a young age kind of feminist icon, Tavi writes:

> But it is absurd to discuss her image from that time as though there was not an apparatus behind it, as though she existed in a vacuum where she was figuring out her sexuality on her own terms, rather than in an economy where young women’s sexuality is rapidly commodified until they are old enough to be discarded.

Okay PLAY THAT BACK one more time. This encapsulates the uncomfortable feeling I've had from watching so many teen (and younger) femmes doing these watered down, sexually explicit moves to these sexually explicit lyrics. Yes, I believe in womxn ~ owning their sexuality ~ but it's also hard to deny that TikTok incentivizes sexual content, especially from younger users.

Consider this Jade video. I feel like everyone on the app has become so desensitized that they barely blink when they see a young person on screen dancing to this song while mouthing the words "I like to be fucked like a slut, come here daddy let me eat it up." Jade knows very well by this point that posting fun dance/lip syncing videos in her bedroom leads to mostly men liking, commenting, and following her account. I was talking about this with someone and he was like, well wasn't that your intention of making these videos as Jade? To appeal to male users? That was never my intention. That probably isn't most 11 year olds' intention either when they make cute dance videos and post them online. At least not at first. Attracting predatory male engagement is a _consequence_ of posting online as a young, femme person, not a goal.

Tavi then goes on to say:

> Even young women who are not megafamous have typically picked up on what makes them appear valuable by the age of 15. Their capacity to perpetuate these standards doesn’t mean they are not also victims of these standards. If anything, it shows how girls’ bodies and sexuality are so deeply regulated by a society that despises women and fetishizes youth that some of us learned how to carry out its work all on our own.

!!! Whether you have 100 or 100 million followers, you still understand that sex sells. A video in a crop top will do better than one with you in a sweatshirt. A video in a bikini will probably perform best. A video where you talk about sex (on TikTok often written as "seggs" or "$3x" to avoid censoring), will likely perform better than one where you talk about the latest book you've read.

So when young people (esp girls) make videos like this one Jade just posted, are they "embracing their sexuality" or instead victim to that narrative that conveniently reassures the world that it is in fact "[sex-negative to suggest that there is anything dubious about sexualizing teenagers](https://www.thecut.com/2021/02/tavi-gevinson-britney-spears-was-never-in-control.html)?"

On an unrelated note, I think this sweat set is a peak Jade outfit. It cost a lot on Depop (it's I AM GIA), but I plan on reselling once she's gotten enough posts in it to make it feel worth it.

Update: On February 27th, @godmodeflow responded to Jade's Q&A on her profile and said: "Not a question but love your experiment and thorough documentation on your site. Day 56 was the clearest post on your motivations 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼" and that felt so lovely and wild to know that someone out there read these words (btw, this is day 56). See [this screenshot](https://whoisjadeontheinter.net/assets/images/day56.jpg) for proof.
