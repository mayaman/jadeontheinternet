Deciding how to perform this brought up a question I've kind of been avoiding up to this point: is Jade a dancer? Currently, like most of the people she follows, she can move decently well, but isn't branding herself as a dancer. On some level, I feel like moving her toward the ~ dance ~ space would conflate my own craving for dance validation with Jade’s specific aspirations. And Jade’s specific aspirations resemble the rest of “[straight TikTok.](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=straight%20tiktok)” The Atlantic’s [description of the Hype House](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/charli-damelio-tiktok-teens/616929/) illustrates this well: “The group’s relentlessly viral posts helped establish the aesthetic of straight TikTok—young, pretty, mostly white people dancing.”

Young, pretty, mostly white people dancing. That’s the kind of content Jade consumes, aspires to, and eventually regurgitates onto the platform. (She’s uhhh half white, so “mostly” isn’t too far of a stretch?) Jade first saw the slowed down version of this dance performed by none other than Charli herself, but this dance was originally created by the extremely talented [@bgottfanns](https://www.tiktok.com/@bgottfanns) who has a (solid) 267.9K compared to Charli's clean, currently, 105.7M (M as in million)... not an unusual imbalance when it comes to dance popularizers and dance creators...
