I intended to spin this into this narrative that I met this boy from NYC HERE in Mexico and then he convinces me to move to NYC with him, but watching it now I feel like it looks like we've been together a while and I'm just telling our story. Doesn't really matter though.

The greatest coincidence is that I had been planning on filming this for a while when, like fate, [this TikTok from @lilmiquela](https://www.tiktok.com/@lilmiquela/video/6964819089600613637) showed up on my FYP. In it, she's saying she met a boy from NYC too. Miquela is Jade's big avatar sis, so felt right to know we were somehow on the same wavelength of trend participation. 

The real question is though... WHO is the boy in Miquela's video and WHO is the boy in Jade's? Only time will tell...
