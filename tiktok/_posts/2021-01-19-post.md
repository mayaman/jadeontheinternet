So I've read that sometimes people make intentional spelling mistakes on TikTok to try and get more people to comment and that is what I did here. I wrote "I am gonna go get that back" instead of "I am gonna go get that _bag_" which I know is actually the right lyric.

Sure enough, someone (XXXX) commented "Bag\*" and I feigned ignorance.

Also, this yawn was completely unintentional I filmed this take right out of it then tried to re-create it (see drafts [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNzNS_4N2-0.) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICmXOD3dpRY)), but ultimately decided to go with the original. Authenticity, is that you?
