I'm in Mexico! It feels important for me to point out that my first reaction to this place being so beautiful was: "wow! what a gorgeous setting for my TikToks!"

If you're on vacation and don't make a dramatic TikTok about being on vacation are you really on vacation?

OR, if you're on vacation and DO spend time making a dramatic TikTok about being on vacation are you really on vacation?

Well, imo, first answer is yes and second answer is no, sooooo that's how my "relaxing trip" is going so far.
