TODO

This is one of those very specific trends that emerges from TikTok that you will only understand if you've seen previous versions of the same thing.

This actually started as a more long form thing that would go on for multiple back and forth bits, but this new version always tees up the person admitting saying, being, or wanting to do something inappropriate and cutting off them fully saying the words at the end.
