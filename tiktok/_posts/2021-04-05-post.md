This is one of those very specific trends that emerges from TikTok that you will only understand if you've seen previous versions of the same thing.

This actually started as a more long form thing that would go on for multiple back and forth bits. The creator tees up the joke by describing something. Then, they will respond to that first clip saying "no, that's a \________ , I'm a \________ !" with both blanks rhyming (at least loosely). See [this one](https://www.tiktok.com/@naomifleischhhh/video/6939293623162817798) and [this one](https://www.tiktok.com/@itssissysheridan/video/6941789643503406342) for long form references. The newer version of the trend usually involves the person filming admitting to saying, being, or wanting to do something inappropriate and cutting themselves off from fully saying the word at the end. The most classic examples of this trend usually involves girls declaring themselves to be a "whore," "stripper," etc. 

While I usually just copy exactly what I see other girls do, I tried to get a little more creative with this one and put Jade's own personal spin on it. There's something satisfying about watching these videos and having the ending surprise you. But it felt strange to be uploading a video where this person with my exact face and body announces, albeit jokingly, that she makes thirst traps. 

I just finished reading [*Fake Accounts* by Lauren Oyler](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/45732027) and there's this one section where the protagonist, whose hobby (really, post complicated break up coping mechanism) is pretending to be a different person on every first Ok Cupid date she goes on in Berlin. One on date, she meets a man who bleached his mustache as a joke. When asked why he kept it on his face, he says, 
> I sometimes to a persona, you know? ... I guess I always assumed I could distance myself from it, because the persona wasn't *me*.

To this our main character responds,

> when the persona is attached to your face it becomes a whole different thing.

(I'm getting stressed out about how to format these quotes I feel like I'm doing it wrong bc these are too short to be block, but I think it's easier to read? Let me know.) 

Only a bit after reading this did I realize that she said this because the mustache is *literally* attached to his face. When I read it, my first thought was, oh, that's what we're all doing out here on TikTok, creating a persona attached to our face.

Jade does make thirst traps, but also that means *I* make thirst traps, so what is a "fake account" really... how is it any different or more fake than our "real" ones? 

In this case, the "fakeness" of Jade's account is really rooted in my selfish desire to distance myself from this persona. That's why I generated a whole alter ego in the first place. I couldn't stand going through a performance of this duration and with this kind of potential visibility while imagining people thinking this was the "real" me.

Maybe I'm just as bad as those journalists who report on "TikTok teens" with a voyeuristic eye, separating themselves and their subjects in order to assert they can deliver a ~ wiser ~ perspective on the app compared to someone who operates inside of the app daily.

\* 

Anyway, as I finish writing this post, this video just became Jade's first to reach over 10K views. I wouldn't go so far as to call it *viral* but that's better than she's ever done before. Notably, this is one of her first pieces of original content. Usually, I tend to try and write her as a "[mirror of culture](https://www.artpractical.com/feature/looking_for_roberta_breitmore/)" (as Lynn Hershman Leeson described her performance as Roberta Breitmore) rather than a producer of original content, but maybe that will start shifting. Jade's letting this newfound success get to her head. I must say though, watching the view count turn from 9999 to 10.0K was a cheap thrill.
