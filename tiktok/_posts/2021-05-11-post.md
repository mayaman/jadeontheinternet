I can not describe to you the disappointment I felt after I had this idea and planned on filming it the next day, but THEN as I was scrolling TikTok saw [another girl who beat me to it](https://www.tiktok.com/@notcardibssister/video/6960742338910080261).

That video had like 2 million likes in a day and it just goes to show that time on TikTok operates at lightning speed. You have to be so quick to post your best ideas on this app otherwise someone else will definitely do it first and even if you get to post it later you'll just look like a copy. 

Also though, let's consider the significance of the stitch feature on TikTok. It's kind of a hack to get people to watch your video for longer. If the video you're stitching has a lot of views, chances are, people will be continue to be captivated by it when it shows up on their For You page. So if you stitch a video with someone really famous, like Addison Rae, people will probably initially be more engaged than if it were you. It's kind of like a really attention grabbing book cover for your content.
