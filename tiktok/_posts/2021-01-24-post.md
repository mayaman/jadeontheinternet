THIS TREND IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES EVER. I first saw [this video](https://www.tiktok.com/@shamrockcowboyhat/video/6919519785747352838) which made me really laugh and inspired the theme of my video here. I recommend checking out all of the videos in the references list though because there's a wide range... can always count on the TikTok community to get creative.

With Jade's post, I realize if you haven't seen the show you probably have no idea what this means. [Baby G](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/18/23/38174486-9160799-image-m-100_1611013929138.jpg) is the only child of rich LA-based Chinese drama queen [Christine Chiu](https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/tv-movies/a35245129/where-is-christine-chiu-bling-empire-now/) on [_Bling Empire_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bling_Empire), a show which premiered on Netflix in the US last week and has been described as a "[real life 'Crazy Rich Asians'](https://www.tatler.com/article/what-is-bling-empire)" form of escapism.

The opening phrase here, "eat the rich," is by default a reference to social theorist Jean-Jacques Rousseau's declaration that "When the people shall have nothing to eat, they will [eat the rich](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_the_rich_(slogan)>)," but Jade's use of it here is more acutely referencing the recent trend of using this slogan to engage the internet in a conversation around class, often in a kind of memeified way. Toward the end of 2020, [a TikTok trend](https://junkee.com/eat-the-rich-tiktok/281339) surfaced where people would post videos acting out "eating" the rich with a friend, but then shockingly realize that the friend has actually shown, in some small way, a sign of wealth. (It's funny. See two of my favorites [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@ratapologist/video/6899611576400137477?refer=embed) and [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@matthewchalamet/video/6899900104736541953).)

Crafting this video today, I was thinking about how, in my liberal, online social media bubble people seem to resent and worship the uber wealthy (and symbols of their lifestyle) simultaneously. Like, I'm picturing about people who pull up online unironically wearing Gucci, partying at the hottest clubs, hanging at friends' ski houses, and vacationing on boats in Europe who are also like, "f capitalism" and "we love bernie." It's like they only want to eat the rich at their own convenience and at no cost to their own pursuit of maintaining their specific status of ~ cool ~. In these circles, pop culture characters like Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, Gigi Hadid are all idolized for their outfits, attitudes, and petty drama filled lifestyles despite outspokenly projecting and extremely opposite of "eat the rich" ethos. I mean, I personally also find it fun to peek at the absurdity of their lives, but by acting as an enthusiastic audience member (or literally, Instagram follower) an explicit endorsement?

I'm just thinking out loud here. I don't have any answers and this video is a dumb (and honestly, bad, someone needs to teach me to be a better at internet humor) meme, but it's also actually surfacing the underlying conflicting desires I feel as a left wing, anti-capitalist, fashion enthusiast, image worshipping, just barely Gen-Z person. Also, I would not go so far to say that I recommend _Bling Empire_, but it's cool to see rich Asian instead rich white people living their best LA life.
