I'm going to be 100% honest and tell you that last night I was lying in bed with my boyfriend and we were staring at each other's faces and he made a (well intentioned) comment that I should probably stop squeezing my face when I look in the mirror (a truly bad habit of mine) because my pores looked big.

I really surprised myself by crying for like a straight hour after that. In my own clearly ironic vanity, I've always thought of myself as the kind of "chill girl" who doesn't place too much emphasis on her looks. But of course, despite that aspiration, I care how people see me. It's human nature, but it's also a learned habit. From an early age, I learned to constantly try to see myself from other people's point of view and understand if they saw me as pretty/cool/desirable or not. (See: [_Ways of Seeing_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/324430/ways-of-seeing-by-john-berger/) by John Berger)

In middle/high school, the realization my appearance was something that I not only could but was expected to control and manipulate led me to become engrossed beauty guru YouTube land. I felt like finally, here was a person who seemed to know what to do! They will _teach_ me how to be a pretty girl, I thought. In a way, it was a relief to see it presented as a learnable skill. The person I remember watching the most was [Bethany Mota](https://www.instagram.com/bethanynoelm/). I just looked her up for the first time in at least 6 years and it looks like she's 25 (just one year older than me) and still making videos. [This "routine/outfit ideas/makeup tutorial"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tl79OunN18) type of video is the kind I remember studying. Looking at this now, I am appalled that that the video is all ideas of how to style yourself for a SICK/LAZY DAY. She put at least 7 products on AND curled her hair?! I saw these videos not as purely entertainment, but instead a kind of bible. I was obsessed with figuring out what the "right" products were and what else I needed to buy (there was always more to buy) to become the ultimate object of desire.

There's some kind of false "keeping it realness" to these get ready with me videos. Their form presumes them to be a kind of reveal: The creator is demonstrating from start to finish the full process of constructing their final form. Yet still, the process is inevitably part of the performance, encouraging its achievability without acknowledging the consequential costs (time/money spent). Filming this video, I kept thinking about [this piece](https://reallifemag.com/glow-aesthetics/) by Dalia Barghouty in Real Life where she comments, "The makeup-in-process image lends itself to before-and-after diptychs, a common trope on social media. It also evokes the possibility of having it both ways â€” of calling attention to makeup as augmentation before passing off its effects as natural." These videos, like the "everyday makeup routine" type of ones, reinforce the expectation that one should be performing this labor every day. I mean yes, it's often fun and enjoyable to get dressed up etc, but you don't see the videos of people's morning routines that don't involve 10 makeup products which makes you feel like everyone does it which makes you feel like you should too.
