I would like to use this post to address the phenomenon that is [drivers license by Olivia Rodrigo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmDBbnmKpqQ). I first heard about the song on TikTok. I remember seeing a video where a girl lip syncs the song to her boyfriend in the car with the caption something along the lines of "he doesn't understand what this means." I was like, well, I also don't think I understand.

Then, someone from my school on Instagram posted a story with a poll: "Do you understand the significance of this song?" The options were _Yes_ or _No, I'm too grown_.

So, not wanting to be too grown, I sprinted to do some googling. The best article I could find at the time was [this one from Seventeen Magazine](https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/music/a35166302/olivia-rodrigo-drivers-license-joshua-bassett-sabrina-carpenter-fact-reactions/) that walked me through the speculative drama between singer Olivia Rodrigo and her High School Musical Disney+ costar Joshua Bassett. Basically, there was gossip that they had been dating, then broke up, and then he started dating a different Disney actress [Sabrina Carpenter](https://www.instagram.com/sabrinacarpenter/) (aka "that blonde girl").

Now, the song has become [a global hit and holds the current record for most streams for a song in a week on Spotify](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKP6QC8B19E/). There's also a [NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/arts/music/olivia-rodrigo-drivers-license.html) analyzing its perfect recipe for success. Yes, like it says, it was the marketing plan, celebrity support, and the gossip, but really, I know, it was TikTok. The platform has insane power to fuel virality not just within its own walls, but clearly beyond them as well, seeping its way into the music industry and the news cycle in a very big way.

I actually laughed out loud when I first saw someone doing this dance to this somber, breakup song. The dance is originally by [@mahakhamidd](https://www.tiktok.com/@mahakhamidd) to a totally different song (you can see it [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@mahakhamidd/video/6903274495843290373)). Some people have already commented on this video seeming confused, but they are clearly not extremely online on TikTok like Jade... iykyk okay.

I would like to just take this moment to acknowledge that Donald Trump left the White House today and I, like much of our nation, am THRILLED.
