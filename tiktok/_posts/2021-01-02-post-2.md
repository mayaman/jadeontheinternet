I learned this dance for the previous iteration of Jade and when I saw Addison posted it with this slowed down sound I was excited to get to do it AGAIN.

Performing these dances, Jade is half thinking about the dance while also half (or maybe more than half) thinking about how she looks on camera doing it.
