I learned this dance for the previous iteration of Jade and when I saw Addison posted it with this slowed down sound I was excited to get to do it AGAIN.

Performing these dances, Jade is half thinking about the dance while also half (or maybe more than half) thinking about how she looks on camera doing it. Dancing on here, for the type of people Jade generally follows, feels more like motion selfies than DANCING.

Like, let's consider how people reference "dancing" on TikTok. At least in English, we call [this](https://youtu.be/tjP8C-sT2ZU?t=15) "dancing", but we also call [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12nL4JUkS4c) "dancing." Clearly, the term encompasses many forms. And its free range makes itself known on TikTok too. Compared to some other TikTok dances, like [this one](https://www.tiktok.com/@jadeontheinternet/video/6901763623799033093?sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6891999718790268421&is_from_webapp=1), [this one](https://www.tiktok.com/@jadeontheinternet/video/6897286042689260805?sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6891999718790268421&is_from_webapp=1), and [this one](https://www.tiktok.com/@jadeontheinternet/video/6892467101504654598?sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6891999718790268421&is_from_webapp=1), today's dance by [Mahak Hamid](https://www.tiktok.com/@mahakhamidd) more closely resembles choreography. Well, this is actually a slowed down version of her [original dance](https://www.tiktok.com/@mahakhamidd/video/6902516194885111046) which went mega viral. To be clear, I could still film this wearing 3 inch platform boots (not seen in the video) while staying within the frame. The choreography still is very much in the genre of TikTok. But I do love the musicality here and bit of flavor to the movement. Learning these is helping exercise my choreo brain muscles while studios are closed.
