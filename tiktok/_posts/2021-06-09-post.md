The first purpose of this blog post is to announce that I will no longer blogging for every single post that goes up on Jade's profile. Frankly, attempting to keep up with the project at that cadence is exhausting and detrimental to my mental health and I would rather write posts more intentionally on a specific topic related to specific post rather than over producing content that doesn't feel as deeply relevant to the core exploration of the project. So! Expect updates still OFTEN, but less often than they have come previously...

The second purpose of this post is to welcome Jade's metamorphosis (ðŸ¦‹ðŸ¦‹ðŸ¦‹) into her latest phase: NYC girl who posts as much as she breathes. I'm going to write more in depth on this archetype in the next post, but because this project is simultaneously an embodied narrative as well as an effort to archive these relics of our current cultural moment, it's to me to shift Jade to NYC in a moment where I can feel the attention on TikTok turning toward a new type of creator. Less bedroom, less teenager, less trends, more city streets, more early 20s, and more "original" "relatable" """""""" content...
