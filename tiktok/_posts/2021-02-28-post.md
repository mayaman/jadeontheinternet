So after doing this makeup/hair I thought I looked pretty e-girl ish, but then I looked up [what an e-girl classically looks like](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/8/1/20748707/egirl-definition-what-is-an-eboy) and it seems Jade has some ways to go to if she ever was to truly embrace that aesthetic... like she would have to dye her hair and have those cute hearts under her eyes.

With the pigtails, fake eyelashes, winged eyeliner, heavy blush, and highlight on the cheeks and nose though, Jade does appear closer to that kind of cute anime inspired look that a lot of the e-girl aesthetic references. That Vox article actually mentions how this kind of style plays into the kink DDLG ([Daddy Dom/Little Girl](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ddlg), I'd never heard the term before reading this article):

> The pigtails, along with the pink nose, eyes, and cheeks, are indicative of youth ... A hypersexualized child aesthetic, which also borrows from anime, means that e-girls often look both older and younger than they are.

Reading that makes me feel very uncomfy knowing that lots of males were probably out there watching Jade through that explicit lens...
