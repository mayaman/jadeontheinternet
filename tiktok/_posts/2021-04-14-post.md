The caption was in part inspired by [@laurenkettering calling the two dance creators](https://www.tiktok.com/@laurenkettering/video/6942978688363285766) (who are two of the biggest names in consistent, viral TikTok choreo) her "literal queens."

Okay, I want to write about something that I'd be scared to post on social media fr because I worry it'd be taken the wrong way and cause controversy, but also it's an observation I don't want to go unnoted and when I write anything on here I am like nobody is reading this so...

I've been thinking about the continuum of gender identity and as a cis femme, I've generally always felt very aligned with how I choose to present. But recently, as I've ventured out in ~ public ~ dressed as Jade with my fake eyelashes, fake freckles, and in an outfit that I never would have put together myself, I feel SO uncomfortable just moving through the world. I feel like I am presenting as the "type of person" who would put that kind of effort into their appearance to other people and that's never something I would personally put on myself. Whenever I run into someone I feel the need to rush and explain that this makeup look, my clothes, my wildflower phone case, etc. are all part of my alter ego. It's not me! Couldn't be me lol okay but really, I get so stressed out.

I've been trying to unpack what exactly I'm afraid of... I know how deeply someone's appearance affects how others reconstruct their identity in their minds. And I worry that people will see me wearing fake eyelashes like casually to the studio on a Wednesday and note in their heads, *interesting, she is the type of person to wear fake eyelashes to the studio on a Wednesday* and even if it's not a conscious thing it will be added to their constantly accumulating perception of who I am in their minds.

I am also feeling like eeeee it's kind of fucked up I'm worried about being judged for wearing this kind of makeup because that means that I think people judge girls who wear that makeup every day and I think people judge them negatively. That's why I want to disassociate.

But also, I do put effort into what I wear every day as myself and don't have this strange, uncomfortable feeling around people seeing me doing that. This feeling I have (going out all decked out as Jade, but not actually identifying with her character) made me wonder if this is the kind of misalignment people who are not cis-gender feel every day they once felt it was necessary to present as cis. OBVIOUSLY, what I am feeling is to a much lesser degree and has nothing to do with my body or feeling femme in general, but this is one of the first times in my life I have ever experienced such a kind of nauseating mismatch between who I see myself as and how I was presenting out in the world. Gender is a performance. Identity is a performance. Yes, but it is still uncomfortable to perform something that doesn't align with how you see YOURSELF. 

I think we are all out here on social media performing ALWAYS. I've stood by that idea since I started this project, but! I am realizing there is a range to which your engagement with your online identity can feel like you're "performing." When I post on my for real personal instagram, I feel like I am performing, but I still work to make it feel like ME. This journey as Jade has been a completely different experience. And for that reason, Jade will never fully be like the influencers she is working to reflect. Because there's an inherent falsity to it all. And Jade isn't who I really want to be, but I wonder if most influencers would ever say the same. They're all trying to be "true to themselves" ... 

No idea if that is making any sense, buuuuuuuuut yeah. If you're appearance isn't aligning with your personal identity, it's uncomfortable and you should be allowed to change it because we're all out here doing that exercise to an extent.
