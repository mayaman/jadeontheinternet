The very ~ sexual ~ nature of this post relates to what I wrote in the previous post, so if you haven't I would read my Day 56 post [_WHY DID I EVER BELIEVE A TEEN GIRL COULD HOLD ALL THE POWER?_]({% post_url /tiktok/2021-02-25-post %}) first.

But to continue the conversation, now I've been thinking about the difference between copying a dance move that happens to be sexual and intentionally doing a sexual move.

When someone more mature looks at a move like the neck grabbing one in this Jade post (which I feel pretty explicitly references a kind of BDSM sexual fantasy) they are like wow so suggestive with you grabbing your throat, doing a body roll, etc. When a younger person sees these moves on stage or online, they are often just thinking that the person performing the dance looks cool and powerful (I am speaking from experience, growing up attending many dance competitions, see [this Dance Moms performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8fxsRDSFfM) for reference) (wait also [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFWUcUS0M0E)). Not to say they have zero sense of what's going on in terms of it seeming kind of provocative, but they may not yet have the full vocabulary or experience to understand that these moves will be perceived as arousing or engaging with someone else's desire.

Major reference here is the movie [_Cuties_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0O7lLe4SmA) which I'd talked about before in [this post]({% post_url /tiktok/2021-01-26-post %}). The film follows an 11 year old girl growing up in an immigrant Muslim family in France who discovers a dance girl group at school and uses the Internet to learn very sexual dance moves to convince the other girls that she's cool enough to join in. I really recommend it.

In an interview about why she made the (turns out, [very controversial](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/12/movies/cuties-netflix.html)) film, director Maïmouna Doucouré says:

> The children see that the more a woman is overly sexualized on social media, the more she's successful ... But my question is, isn't the objectification of a woman's body that we often see in our Western culture not another kind of oppression?

Again, solely championing the narrative of young girls doing these kinds of moves as "sex-positive" or "sexual-liberation" ignores the systemic oppression that incentives the objectification of womxn's bodies. Those who are in favor of objectifying young femme bodies are benefiting from that narrative. I'm all for sex positivity and powerful sexy dance moves (obviously!), but on the Internet it's impossible to ignore the built in reward mechanisms that encourage the sexualization of young kids, with or without them being fully aware of it.
