    caption: Felt insecure about how my body looked in this one.

The first video I saw participating in this trend was [this one](https://www.tiktok.com/@thisismythirdtiktokacct/video/6954830398656498949). It was kind of funny, clearly a joke, and she mentioned being wasian, which I related to, so I saved it to possibly do my own version later.

After watching that one, it became a bigger and bigger trend where people used this sound to joke about having small boobs, being a virgin, being single, having a twilight phase etc. Some were funny, but it was obviously meant to be humor that pretended these small things were a big deal.

Okay so this was my impression of the trend when I made this video for Jade, but as I sat down to write this I was looking at the sound for this video and at the very top is [this video](https://www.tiktok.com/@joeycassanova/video/6948288079174126853) made by [@joeycassanova](https://www.tiktok.com/@joeycassanova) where he details very real traumas he's experienced over his lifetime as he reacts to the intense stream of gunshots in the audio. 

I clicked on his profile to see if he's reacted to his original video initiating this major trend and not only has he reacted, but the story of the trend he's created's appropriation has now been picked up and written about in The Rolling Stone in an article titled [*A Black Creator Made a Video About His Trauma. TikTok Turned It Into a Joke*](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/joey-cassanova-tiktok-trend-black-creators-1164148/). The piece details how Cassanova (who is a retired MMA fighter) decided to post a video sharing his life experiences to this audio that included gunshots (he said, "I thought it was perfect because it felt like I’ve been shot at my whole life,"), but then how the trend was appropriated by many white creators including ones with large followings to make light of their own "hardships." Reading this actually makes me disgusted with TikTok and this trend and myself for posting this video because white creators appropriating Black creators' content ideas has LONG been an issue on this platform and that's bad enough, but in this specific instance imagining Cassanova having to see the video where he shared his most intimate and traumatic experiences turn into a STUPID TREND ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY OF HAVING SMALL BOOBS makes me alsdfja;lksjdf;alksjdf so angry. 

Ironically, when I posted this on Jade's account, some people started commenting things like "There are people starving and suffering rn and you are sad about this shit" and this one: 
> "Oooooohhhh look at me I’m a cute girl that got rejected from STANFORD?!?!?! ANDDD I HAVE A CRUSH ON A SCORPIO?! My life is so hardddd." 

I thought it was weird people weren't realizing it was obviously a joke and even commented saying that. BUT NOW, I am like they are right this trend and this post is FUCKED UP given its origins. Considering making another video addressing this... feels off brand for Jade, but maybe should be the direction we move her in...
