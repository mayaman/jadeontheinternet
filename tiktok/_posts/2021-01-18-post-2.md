I already knew this dance before I even filmed my first draft. Unlike some other more complicated dances, I essentially absorbed this one through osmosis by way of scrolling.

When I finally got around to reading [Rob Horning's newsletter from last month](https://tinyletter.com/robhorning/letters/the-general-drift-is-a-mere-activity-in-a-certain-direction), I kept thinking about his reference to Fredric Jameson's idea in "[Reification and Utopia in Mass Culture](https://www.jstor.org/stable/466409?seq=1)" that argues we never consume objects of mass culture for the first time. That's exactly how I feel about TikTok dances. I never remember when I first saw one, but after scrolling by the same one enough times it feels impossible to imagine a state where I had never seen it.

Horning goes on to say:

> If it seems like we never hear songs "for the first time," that's because the point of them is to make us feel like we've never been excluded; we can believe that we never had to learn how to fit in, that it came naturally, spontaneously, the way "influence" is always just a reminder, the way content just shows up in our feeds.

These dances are TikTok's way of making sure nobody feels left out. Their an easy trend to follow and an easy one to repeat (or at least attempt to repeat). I never had to learn how to do this dance. Instead, it felt like it came naturally, like I had known it all along.
