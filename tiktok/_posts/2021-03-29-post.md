Although I am undeniably late to this trend (I'd say it peaked last fall) I've been eager to participate because the combination of the style of video uploaded with this sound forcibly reveals a core feature of our networked practice of self "expression": Our desire to not only be a protagonist, but really more importantly, to be seen by others as one.

[This article](https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/akzby4/tiktok-is-teaching-gen-z-what-it-really-means-to-be-the-main-character) in *i-D* gives a nice overview of the phenomenon of "main character energy," but unfortunately resorts to posing the tiiiiiired question of Gen-Z and self obsession. The writer asks, "Is it an example of how younger generations are embracing self-love and self-respect, or a worrying slide into self-obsession and narcissism." This line of questioning disappoints me because it implies individual or generational psychological fault while failing to zoom out and acknowledge the social media induced pressure to self brand and self promote as a form of work (that's potentially paid! if you work hard enough!).

That said, I really appreciate the piece "[Main Character Energy](https://reallifemag.com/main-character-energy/)" by Coco Kockner in *Real Life* because it points out that the idea is less about self-obsession and more about visibility: "Main character energy is not a matter of being “individualistic” or singular but rather a matter of being extremely legible."

What's most !!!! fascinating to me about this trend not the mindset it encourages, but the *way it's communicated*.

Kockner does an excellent job of breaking this down, I really recommend you just read the whole piece because I am exercising extreme restraint by not copying and pasting entire paragraphs in here, but I really want to highlight a few details. First: 

> TikTok users playing with the idea of “main character energy” are not identifying with individual actors or larger-than-life roles but rather with the materiality of cinema itself. They absorb its logic and distill it down.

For example, in this video, Jade isn't doing anything DRAMATIC. She's doing very basic activities (and I mean basic not in the kind of insulting way): Getting coffee, eating fries with friends, going to a matcha shop, walking down the street, etc. But! With this ~ cinematic framing, ~ these small tasks are documented and repurposed in pursuit of communicating a ceratin depth of character, as the classic "filming the star of the movie doing something mundane to imply she is important, worthy of focus, and thinking deep thoughts" tactic goes in film.  

And one more note from Kockner on how this operates in the social media ecosystem: 

> Each of the formulas and stylized self-presentations suggest how the cinematic condition has extended well beyond metaphor. We are not merely the star of the movie in our minds; rather we are forced to continually assert ourselves as the main character for one another in our feeds.

On TikTok, it's not just about thinking or even believing yourself to be the main character. It's about the externalization of that belief. Using strategies borrowed from cinema, we can constantly work to prove that we can occupy that role on other people's minds, even if it's just for 15 seconds on the (very) small screen.

If you're acting like the main character, but nobody SEES you acting like the main character, were you really ever the main character at all?
