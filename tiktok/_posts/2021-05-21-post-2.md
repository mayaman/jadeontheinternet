It is SO FUNNY how sometimes the weirdest filters on TikTok start trending. I started seeing this one pop up all over my feed today and wanted to participate mainly for archival sake because... lol what is this.

Look at the references they're pretty funny. The best moments are [when the filter glitches](https://www.tiktok.com/@owenreffett/video/6964155370726100229) and you actually see the person full frame performing for the video. I tried to make that happen a couple times in this one, but it was honestly tough facial tracking has gotten veryyyyyy good.
