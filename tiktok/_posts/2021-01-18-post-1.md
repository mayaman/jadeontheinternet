Like I mentioned before, this type of video again falls into my personally labeled "Surprise! I'm hot" category. These videos are like bite size versions of the [movie makeover trope](https://www.crfashionbook.com/culture/g33483733/movie-makeover-montage-clueless-legally-blonde-princess-diaries/): All the surprise and satisfaction with a fraction of the cost to produce OR to consume.

Nearly every video in this trend starts with the creator wearing (often geeky looking) glasses. It reminded me [this New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/euphoria-and-the-flawed-art-of-gen-z-prophesying) I read reviewing the TV show _Euphoria_ where Doreen St. FÃ©lix writes, commenting on the initially insecure yet intelligent character Kat, "she wears glasses--the universal sign, onscreen, that a woman isn't seen as attractive." On TikTok we're all putting the movie tropes we know and love from the big screen to work.

In [_The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Everyday_Life), Erving Goffman writes extensively about the duality between "front stage" and "back stage" spaces, aka where the performers perform and where the performers relax. He defines the back stage as "a place, relative to a given performance, where the impression fostered by the performance is knowingly contradicted as a matter of course."

Here, I feel like part of the performance involves performing an _exaggerated_ backstage. The point of this trend is to act like your natural, unadorned state is as grotesque as possible in order to provide as intense a shock factor as possible when you reveal your final, "performance ready" form.
