This is the longest break I've ever taken from posting on Jade's account since the start of this project. This was partly because I had some other work picking up, but mostly because I've been struggling with my mental/emotional health and couldn't engage with the TikTok in the context of Jade in a way that didn't feel detrimental to my wellbeing which I think says something significant (it's also no secret, but imo doesn't get taken seriously enough) about the app.

Captioning this "comeback" video "it's been a minute" in translation (for those who are not with it) actually means "it's been a while." *Really*, it's only been two weeks since Jade's last post, but in TikTok time that's an eternity. Time operates different inside its insular digital universe not by accident, but by design. The app (English version at least, in Chinese the name means "vibrating sound" I just looked that up) is literally named after the sound a clock makes as it marks the seconds passing. TikTok was built to intentionally manipulate our experience of time. As [this *Wired* article points out](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-time/?code=SHLf3eeFNNVDjafBa45Ob6Jh-sNRD_RedBdbm5EBt66), tactics such as hiding the timestamp on videos on the FYP and covering the current time on user's phone screens (e.g. when you're filming a video) helps boost engagement for ByteDance.

Most big creators post at least once a day, if not multiple times a day (but three times per day feels like the max). Sometimes, they'll [post](https://www.tiktok.com/@fabismells/video/6885538449147923718) [something](https://www.tiktok.com/@brookemonk_/video/6943114296041819398) [like](https://www.tiktok.com/@avarxseee/video/6866500741926898950) "I'm busy/tired/exhausted, so here's draft" as if simply not posting while being busy/tired/exhausted was not an option.   

The pace of production/consumption on the app not only affects the creators' posting cadence, but also affects the life cycle of trends. If I open the app to scroll after a two week break, I'm totally unfamiliar with the new sounds/dances/jokes surfacing on my For You page. I would estimate that a classic TikTok trend has a life cycle of about two weeks (that's being pretty generous). The trend is probably at its peak for about one week. After that, it's appropriate to upload a video participating, but while admitting your "late" to the trend. 

As a creator, this makes it extreeeeemely difficult to queue up videos too far in advance because you have no idea what will be trending by the time you post and if you post something "old" the content will feel stale.

These observations may seem obvious to you if you use TikTok regularly, but I've started to consider how this project might not only be an ongoing performance/form of embodied criticism, but also an archival practice in anticipation of a world where TikTok and this current moment in pop culture are inevitably relics of the past. It's important to me to document what might feel mundane now, but nostalgic and historic (oooooh) later. In the future, our present now will be Internet history : - )
