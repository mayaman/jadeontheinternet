Listen I posted this one and it was not performing that well in terms of likes and views and over the 24 hours it was live I kept looking through the MANY drafts I took for this post and decided I actually liked another draft better SO I posted that one (see above post for now live post and also all the drafts) and then archived this one (ie made it private).

Instances like this make it really clear that the time that goes into posting a TikTok doesn't just involve the hours you spend filming and editing, but also the time you lose watching your own video over and over trying to see it from someone else's point of view AND refreshing your notifications/profile,hoping more likes or views might appear. The whole process is so draining and endless.
