WELCOME to Jade's next phase: NYC, skinny, aspirational lifestyle, extremely online bitch. There are a few archetypes for this kind of TikTok girl, the most famous one being [Victoria Paris](https://www.tiktok.com/@victoriaparisf), the 22 year old who rose to fame by posting 20 - 30 vlog style videos a day about her life in New York City. [This Embedded article](https://embedded.substack.com/p/one-weird-trick-to-being-victoria) on her ascent accurately highlights the extreme privilege that plays a role in her success... she's skinny, conventionally pretty, wears cool outfits, and overshares about her life. 

I've always felt there was something eerie about her success. On the surface, she's talking about running, fashion, New York, etc... all things that do seem to be truly parts of her life, yet she manages to post about everything in a way that makes you feel, as the viewer, that you are getting to see EVERYTHING. It appears that there's nothing she feels uncomfortable about sharing. This actually aligns with her attitude... in an [interview with *Interview*](https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/victoria-paris-wants-to-big-brother-her-life), she openly announces that she wants "streaming 24/7" and to have her "life on display."

Victoria Paris started posting heavily on TikTok in December of 2020 and now, today, has reached one million followers. At first, she seemed like an anomaly, like a glitch in the system because nobody had risen to fame in quite the same way (a mean she's a baby glitch... a big glitch would be someone who wasn't white, skinny, cis, and able bodied ([*see Glitch Feminism*](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3668-glitch-feminism))!  imagine!)...

But then, enter [Kate Glavan](https://www.tiktok.com/@kateglavan) who started posting intensely in May of 2021 and has quickly risen to have over 20K followers in a span of a few weeks. Embedded released [another article](https://embedded.substack.com/p/new-brunette-just-dropped) covering Glavan's emergence on the TikTok scene. As the piece points out, the recipe for her videos feels similar to Paris's pioneering tactic of oversharing and overposting all while being a hot, privileged, NYC bitch. Glavan's quick rise to fame makes the whole Paris success story feel less like a glitch and more like feature that has been programmed into the TikTok algorithm that only now we are fully uncovering. 

Glavan herself has addressed and rolled her eyes at the comparison, claiming that she's just here to "talk about politics." While I appreciate wanting to "talk about politics" she specifically has chosen to do that while sprinkling in videos of her talking about [saving up for four years to get a MNZ dress](https://www.tiktok.com/@kateglavan/video/6971095545809030406) RIGHT alongside a video of her wearing that (probably upwards of $400) dress with an audio that claims to be [distressed due to capitalism](https://www.tiktok.com/@kateglavan/video/6971100148470451461). She talks about [eating disorders and body dysmorphia](https://www.tiktok.com/@kateglavan/video/6973284057794809093) while also making [lots of videos about her going running while wearing expensive running clothes and looking fit and skinny](https://www.tiktok.com/@kateglavan/video/6969941911809395974)! Her account constantly contradicts itself, yet what remains consistent is her dedication to promoting herself as a hyper left, wellness advisor, fashion icon, fitness inspiration kind of figure. She perfectly suspends herself between these identities never leaning too far into one or another. Glavan epitomizes our current cultural moment better than maybe anyone else I've seen on the platform. We're caught between loving and hating wellness, fashion, fitness, politics, and influencers and Kate Glavan has appeared to help propel us along this endless cycle. Also, let me be clear, I actually really like her and think her content is great and feel the same way she does about LOTS of topics she covers. But! Important to acknowledge the ideological inconsistencies and that at the end of the day, her content is truly in service of self promotion (and promoting her podcast, which I've been listening to and have mixed feels about).

Okay anywayyyy, this trend of NYC girls quickly flooding people's For You Pages hasn't gone unnoticed. [This video](https://www.tiktok.com/@dababyaries/video/6973443921263267078) by @dababyaries recognizes this phenomenon and the comment section does too. Scrolling TikTok now, I can feel this slow, but significant shift from TikTok culture revolving around Charli D'Amelio/Addison Rae girl next door types to focusing on this new always on vlogger who lives a seemingly "cool life" type. But what most people forget to discuss is that these girls who are blowing up on TikTok for posting a lot are absolutely spending most of their time posting a lot! You don't see the moments they spend filming drafts, running around NYC looking for a place to put their phone to film, running into strangers on the street as they are talking to the camera. All you see is what they design you to see and nobody is talking about the extremely damaging exterior effects ([aka](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2021/5/25/22451987/influencer-burnout-tiktok-clubhouse) [influencer](https://harpers.org/archive/2021/06/tiktok-house-collab-house-the-anxiety-of-influencers/)! [burnout](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/style/creator-burnout-social-media.html)!) of keeping up this constant TikTok vlogger girl lifestyle.
