I've noticed that TikTok now seems to be pushing Jade's videos to the FYP much more than before. Now every videos seems to be getting at least 500ish views on the first day. This is much more than before when her videos would usually get on average maybe 150 views. I think it's either that she has more followers not OR that she is leaning into this NYC girl paradigm.......... unclear. 

I was at the Jersey shore here on a family reunion and went on a walk on the beach to hide behind some large storage units to film this series of beach videos because I felt too embarrassed to be filming Jade's TikToks out in the open.

Something I want to work on over the next few months is getting more comfortable completely embodying Jade in public because she wouldn't be embarrassed I don't think.
