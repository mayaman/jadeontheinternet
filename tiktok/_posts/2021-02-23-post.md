I've been saving this audio for a while so I could film a video to it. But before I had a chance to make this video, I listened to the _Reply All_ episode [ _The Fever_](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/wbhjbr/27-the-fever) which had me thinking long and hard about the Asian fetish diagnosis.

The _Reply All_ episode told the story of a girl who discovered her white boyfriend was simultaneously cheating on her with multiple other Asian women. Horrifying. At the end of the episode, the storytellers concluded that if a guy had dated more than two Asian women before, it was a red flag that he miiiiight have an Asian fetish... aka "yellow fever" aka stay! away! Discussing this with my boyfriend, we both felt like relativity was important factor here. Had a guy dated ONLY two Asian women before or were two out of his six exes Asian. Big difference, right? How do you articulate the fine line between coincidence, preference, and fetish?

While I was thinking about this, I discovered the instagram account [@thefleshlightchronicles](https://www.instagram.com/thefleshlightchronicles/) run by this girl Lillian (but looks like it's been inactive for a while) that [exposes creepy Asian fetish guys on Tinder](https://www.vice.com/en/article/kzxpdn/fleshlight-chronicles-asian-fetish-tinder-memes). She has [this post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BgHxKJqhT1i/) that enlightened things for me where she writes, "Fetishization is not innocuous; it is not 'preference.' Fetishization is the combination of sexual prejudice and power."

While performing as Jade on TikTok, it's become clear that Jade's main source of power on the app derives from her ability to make herself desirable to male users. Her "asian-ness" becomes something to weaponize in pursuit of more views. It's kind of a strange power flip?

TikTok again seemed to read my mind by serving [this video from @jamparadmall](https://www.tiktok.com/@jamparadmall/video/6932608387876277510) on my FYP a couple days ago. In it she claims how she'd be fine if someone left her and said "your loss" because she's "every rich white mans fetish." Then in the caption she writes: "It's not about what you can do for yellow fever it's about what yellow fever can do for you." This feels both awfully complicit and strangely empowering? I'm personally struggling to reconcile my frustration with Asian women being fetishized and my admiration of women who use this prejudice to actually gain power in a situation themselves.

Okay now back to the audio in this video. This script feels especially weiiiiiiird to use because it's implying that you (the person making this video) are the physical product of a white man's Asian fetish. There's not a lot of truth to Jade using this audio because her dad is the Chinese one and both of her parents are very liberal, but nobody knows that. This is like an ad for yellow fever, look what you can create! Just kidding. But it is weird to see all these half Asian people using this sound. It's bringing us together in an uncomfortable way.
