Being openly sad on the Internet is now COOL. If you are at all someone who is ~ online ~ I feel like you must get what I mean. Admitting that you have moments of feeling down is relatable (because that is literally life), but publicly posting about that online has now become maybe a way to both gain attention and gain something that feels closer to the elusive "authenticity" we all strive to exemplify through our online profiles.

People's craving for relatable content surfaces on TikTok in an aggressive way. The app sometimes feels like an endless mashup of Instagram, YouTube, and just MEMES. The way you feel like you can peek inside someone's life so quickly is what makes it feel different from any other platform though.

James Poniewozik [puts it nicely](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/10/arts/TIK-TOK.html): "The pervasive feeling I got from TikTok was inclusion. It wasn’t, like Instagram, trying to persuade me of its users’ happiness, or, like Twitter, of their rightness."

TikTok is weirdly like both the front stage performance AND the behind the scenes. Transition videos are a great example of this kinda dual phenomenon. Erving Goffman would be THROWN by these layers. But I think he would, well really I'm guessing based on how I feel, but I think he would argue that the "backstage" kind of self presented on the app is ACTUALLY still a performance of the "backstage" self. Like, yes, you sitting in your bed filming on the front-facing camera is different from you walking into a party, but it's also different from you lying in your bed looking at your friend.

Filming this, my audience was completely unknown. On Instagram at least I know okay most of the people who will see this are my followers, but on TikTok anything could go viral when you least expect it.

This video, I do not think, will go viral. Despite the maybe ELEVEN different drafts I filmed of this to get this right. Two are in the [Junkyard](https://whoisjadeontheinter.net/draftjunkyard/) if you want a taste. Took at least 45 minutes total if not more.
