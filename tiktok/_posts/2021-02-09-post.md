Last night, Ed Westwick (who plays Chuck Bass on Gossip Girl) made his debut appearance on TikTok with THIS video. It's so funny when a new celeb joins the app and everyone on it freaks out and will duet their video with their [hand](https://www.tiktok.com/@sam.bt/video/6927525514366176513) [over](https://www.tiktok.com/@laurenkettlecorn/video/6927362759562743046) [their](https://www.tiktok.com/@chloblowz/video/6926996906518301957) [mouth](https://www.tiktok.com/@adrianardarte/video/6927046862084132102) [like](https://www.tiktok.com/@carmenbartolo/video/6927051950055820546) [this](https://www.tiktok.com/@carolineboris/video/6927031703705816325). But I saw a couple girls do one [dressing up as Blair](https://www.tiktok.com/@whatverowears/video/6927097328335588614) and thought that would be fun.

Kind of think Jade's reaction wasn't dramatic enough to get much traction... that's the thing about the hand over the mouth it's like a caricature of the feeling of shock and people on this app LOVE a good exaggerated reaction.
