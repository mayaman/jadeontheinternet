In the analytics built into TikTok (that anyone can turn on), you can see where most of your views are coming from for each video. Options include: "For You," "Following," "Personal profile," and "Sound."

On Jade's last video's analytics there was 0% of views coming from the For You page, so I figured she might be [shadow banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_banning) (a video not going on the fyp at all is usually a sign).

At this point, Jade's videos usually get about 100 views on the day that they are posted. But her last video getting a very low number sent me into a long spiral of attempting to understand if I was shadow banned and what that meant. Eventually, I decided to post this video (that is basically a repeat of [this one](https://www.tiktok.com/@jadeontheinternet/video/6925829960070434053)) to test things. I actually often see girls that I follow post a video captioned "[testing something](https://www.tiktok.com/@savannahhmccrayy/video/6874289253719788806)." Pretty sure that something most always be... the algorithm? Turns out that this video of Jade already has way more views than her last one, so maybe the shadow ban has been lifted?

Anyway, this whole ordeal really messed with me because I was so concerned for the project's sake that I was BANNED, but it also was a true feeling of panic and paranoia that all creators must feel when their videos don't do very well relatively. Dangerous game to deposit all of your hopes and dreams into a platform that has the power to "[take down or surpress your content without formal notice](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9901461/what-is-shadow-banning-tik-tok)" and (allegedly, previously) would explicitly "[suppress posts created by users deemed too ugly, poor, or disabled for the platform](https://theintercept.com/2020/03/16/tiktok-app-moderators-users-discrimination/)." SO, when you think you're shadow banned, not only are you sad about video views, but you are ALSO haunted by the thought that, maybe, you're just not pretty enough for the platform to promote you : - (
