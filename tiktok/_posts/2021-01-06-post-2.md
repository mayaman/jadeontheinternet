OKAY so today was the infamous day at the capital where a [mob of Trump supporters stormed the US capital](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/12/us/capitol-mob-timeline.html). Those in attendance primarily included [white supremacists and conspiracy theorists](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/us/names-of-rioters-capitol.html) who were rioting in protest of Trump's loss in the 2020 presidential election.

If you even touched the Internet on this day, you know it was mad chaos. I mean the IRONY. During the BLM protests, conversatives got allllll high and mighty but NOW they should be so embarrassed by how much worse they look out there rioting. Plenty of [memes accurately encapsulated](https://www.buzzfeed.com/eleanorbate/capitol-riots-black-lives-matter-police-celeb-reactions) the outrageous difference between handling of protests in this country.

I also saw [this hilarious TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@einsteinsbussy/video/6914798224175828230) that I shared with everyone I talked to that week. But this post by Jade specifically was inspired by a few specific things (beyond my own personal outrage).

1. Seeing a girl Jade follows whose content resembles what she aspires to [posting about it](https://www.tiktok.com/@teszz/video/6914773925142596870)

2. I've been reading Legacy Russell's _Glitch Feminism_ (SO many of her thoughts to unpack re Jade...), but something I've been thinking about endlessly is her commentary on Amalia Ulman's [_Excellences and Perfections_](https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/amalia-ulman-excellences-perfections). She writes: "Ulman did not disrupt or provide substantive feedback to the status quo, but rather her performance, basic as ever, reveled in it."

I'm still a major fan of Ulman's work, but reading this helped me realize that as Jade's creator and editor, I don't want to make her another basic influencer type who actively ignores what's happening out in the world. I mean, even personally on my own accounts, I get super nervous to make any kind of political statement because I fear I'll be saying it somehow in the "wrong way," but I want Jade to be different.

As a personality, Jade is more comfortable shouting what she feels online and I want to emphasize that as an important piece of her character alongside her aspirational content. [Lil Miquela's](https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/?hl=en) use of her platform serves as a good example of this. She consistently addresses social issues/organizations doing social work while still remaining a very classic type of influencer figure. I see no benefit, just for "art's sake" to add to the noise of aspirational influencers holding back their political opinion out of fear of lost followers. Personally, I realized I feel that the situation is too precarious to go that far for the sake of "performance."

I also thought using this audio that's presumably about an ex-crush or lover who has done you wrong was funny, but alas the video didn't get much traction.
