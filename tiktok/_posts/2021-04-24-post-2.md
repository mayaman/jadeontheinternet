I don't think I've written much about the specific way that sounds operate on TikTok yet, but I wanted to showcase the process of a sound evolving via this video and the one in the previous post to give a sense of the phenomenon.

There's a lot of discussion about how [TikTok sounds affect the music industry](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/27/917424879/how-tiktok-has-changed-the-music-industry), but it's been hard for me to find much writing or discourse around how people remix sounds (not just music!) that become popular on TikTok like this. Oh writing this now though, I'm reminded of [a piece my friend Asha wrote for Slate](https://slate.com/technology/2020/09/tiktok-brain-send-help.html) on TikTok brain which is a good take if you're interested in thinking more specifically about the way audio operates on the app.

Okay, so first, you want to watch [this video](https://www.tiktok.com/@jadeontheinternet/video/6954767148732419333). This is the original popular sound of this kind. It's used to make an embodied meme where a person mouths the words "mmmm feet" but overtop places text saying what they actually want to make a joke about. In my case in this one, I decided it was having a crush on my friend's brother which is 100% false, but I was inspired to say that because I thought maybe it would be relatable. Okay, then! At the end of THIS sound, there's the panicked voice saying "I don't think it's a joke anymore!" implying that actually the person is now truly into the thing they wrote out.

Okay NOW, watch [this video](https://www.tiktok.com/@jadeontheinternet/video/6954767148732419333). Someone uploaded an altered version of the previous video's sound with a surprise ending. If you spend enough time on TikTok, you hear trending sounds over and over and over, so watching this video you would think it's going one way, but it surprises you with a twist. People like that.

And then FINALLY, [this](https://www.tiktok.com/@roanmclean/video/6955919402860547334)! Often a sound's final form will emerge on TikTok as someone different just saying the sound in their own way. That video came up on my For You page, but after searching through the sound (which currently has only been used 1976 times) I found the original video (It's labeled "Original" by TikTok) [here](https://www.tiktok.com/@emilyxbuechler/video/6953662347655400710).

Wild ride, right? It happens all the time with popular sounds. These small remixed sound bites essentially become mass scale inside jokes on the app.
