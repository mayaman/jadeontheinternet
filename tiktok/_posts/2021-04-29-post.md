AGAIN, here I didn't realize the origins of this trend (which I had seen mostly posted by non-Black creators around mid April 2021) originated in the Black community online in earlier in the year as a [spoof of the ending of Black movies](https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/twista-faith-evans-hope-tiktok-trend/).

I only realized after watching [this TikTok posted by @lelegenevieve](https://www.tiktok.com/@lelegenevieve/video/6953770839204531461) where she calls out its origins.

Are we noticing a PATTERN HERE?!

I thought this was an appropriate theme to go with here because Jade is actually modeled off of other girls that are on TikTok but! this phrase is also always used as a way to put down the concept of women in general I think and sucks. Someone commented, "90% of women are like this" and I asked, "who are are the other 10%" and they have yet to get back to me and I am genuinely curious to hear what they have to say so...
