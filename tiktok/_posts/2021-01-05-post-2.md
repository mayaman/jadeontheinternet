Okay I got overwhelmed adding references (please see links below (only the last one is really MY inspiration)) one because I am shocked by this trend, but two because I am literally shocked by people's BUTTS. They look so GOOD and bouncy.

I do feel like this is kind of a new TikTok era thing, the butt obsession. I mean obviously it's ALWAYS been there in the world, but it definitely wasn't so much an Instagram or Twitter thing you know? Not really a YouTube thing either. But on TikTok being able to shake and show off your ass will get you capital "V" Views and is seen as not only acceptable, but like worshipped and encouraged, even expected.

I'm having a weird time writing this because I am alllllll about sex/body positivity and enjoying the process of showing off one's own body, but this whole trend feels like a weird competition? One of the girls even captioned [her video](https://www.tiktok.com/@kellyyschulte/video/6912974173102935301) "I‚Äôm an object üòÖ #fyp"... That sweating/smiling face explains exactly how I feel about this ordeal. Like it's fun, but eeeeeee it's also voluntary objectification to please a system that is built to encourage the ~ male gaze ~ I feel like I am in #malegaze TikTok. I am sitting on my phone watching these videos like... will she üçë or will she NOT?
