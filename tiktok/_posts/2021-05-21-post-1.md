Posting to document the third single off of Olivia Rodrigo's debut album SOUR that JUST CAME OUT. 

This filter emerged as a trend for this song on TikTok and it feels right because the song has a very early 2000s rock kind of vibe. Lots of people are [comparing the song to Paramore](https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/music/a36476671/olivia-rodrigo-good-4-u-paramore-misery-business-mashup/). The angst! The dancing in your room angry at the world kind of energy! 

Olivia is truly a TikTok, Gen Z phenomenon. There's something about each one of her single that works very well with TikTok's girls lip syncing lyrics culture and speaks to the emotional drama of being a teenage girl and a specific, mature, yet still melodramatic way.

I was VERY paranoid while filming this I kept thinking that the air bnb hosts (whose home looks out on the pool) were judging me hard and thinking *like look at this dumb influencer wannabe girl who is about to drop her phone in the pool for this video*. I think my paranoia does taint my performance tbh. I much prefer to perform Jade in private.
