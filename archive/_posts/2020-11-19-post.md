Everyone wants to be a protagonist.

This trend of lip syncing the lines of the beautiful girl in a movie to the camera initially confused me, but the more I think about it, the more it totally makes sense.

By using this sound, any creator is aiming to set up a specific point of view of themselves. This video asks its audience to see Jade as a sweet, object of desire. The kind of girl who would catch this boy's eye. The kind of girl he would call beautiful. The kind of girl who would deny it.

It's a role that so many girls dream of playing in their own lives. Filming this video feels like a hack to see how being this girl feels for a short thirty-something second. Posting this video feels like a test to see if you being this character feels believable to other people.
