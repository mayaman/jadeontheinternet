    caption: I was going to do a head turn transition at the end but eventually abandoned that idea because I couldn't get it to look right.

I saw another girl do [this trick](https://www.tiktok.com/@thebellakellis/video/6902874486547270918) where she walks into the sunlight and suddenly looks AMAZING. Tried it out, but feel like I should have spent more time out of the sun in the beginning to emphasize the CONTRAST.

Posted this video and the previous video both within the same hour to see how they would perform relative to each other. This one ended up getting way less attention than the other one. Not sure if it's because it was posted second? Or is not as compelling of a video? Unclear.

A friend noted that Jade should probably change her hair up sometimes, so I tried a new look I'd seen some other girls pull off on TikTok that I actually really like. These two little side braids. I straightened my hair at my parent's apartment because my mom has a straightener and I don't. My boyfriend says this hairstyle makes Jade look younger?
