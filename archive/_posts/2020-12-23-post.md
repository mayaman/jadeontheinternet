Okay this sound I think is pretty SCANDALOUS (apparently from the TV show You?) and I was filming this in the window and my mormon neighbors suddenly walked by as I was screaming at my propped up phone asking William if he wanted to fuck me and I could tell they were like....... is that our nice neighbors 24 year old daughter????? I was very embarrassed.

On TikTok these little moments of "acting" are pretty popular, where you pretend that you're in a scene and the viewer is watching you from another character's point of view. I've mentioned this before, but it really feels like there's this obsession with placing yourself as a video creator in the position of the protagonist.

I actually read this piece in high school and still think of it ALL THE TIME, but it feels very relevant. It's by Tavi Gevinson for her publication Rookie Mag (which, if you haven't delved into their archives, I recommend, it saved me in many ways I think). In it she references a tumblr comment where the writer says, "[most people think girls want to be skinny because of Hollywood and Vogue. This girl wanted to be skinny because she wanted to be a _protagonist_](https://www.rookiemag.com/2012/01/how-to-not-care-what-other-people-think-of-you/)."

People want to look like the person who plays the lead, who holds others attention. And audio snippets like this let everyone live out that mini movie fantasy for 60 seconds. It's less acting and more aspiration to me. Not that Jade wants a creepy William in her life though...
