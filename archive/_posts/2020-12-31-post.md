Hello. As I was reflecting on this project as 2020 comes to a close, I looked back at Jade's 62 day journey and realized that she currently was not appearing how I imagined her to be.

I learned a lot these past two months by posting every day and intensely observing TikTok as a space for young, femme identity. Considering all of this, I realized I wanted to start Jade fresh in 2021.

Some things will change, some will stay the same, but I am focusing this new version of the performance more on Jade as a character and less on upholding certain criteria like "must post once a day."

This channel acts as an archive of what I currently see as an extended dress rehearsal. The TikTok account has been deleted and a new one was created from scratch. All of her old videos, drafts, and significant comments are archived via this site and on YouTube.

As an artist, it's important for me to be able to cut ties with things I have made that I don't feel meet my own set of standards. So, with this post, I said goodbye to the old v0 Jade and hello to v1 Jade, starting fresh as a Capricorn in 2021.
