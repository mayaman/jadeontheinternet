I guess I already did one series of posts in a bathroom before, but this bathroom (at my parent's house where I grew up in Pennsylvania) feels like a better representation of the [classic bathroom TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/style/tik-tok-bathrooms.html).

This dance doesn't feel nearly as popular yet as other dances I've done, but maybe that will end up being useful?

Was feeling a little worried that these leggings are so tight they make my body look bad when it's coming over the sides, but I think it's subtle enough that it's okay. They were the only clean leggings I had.

These tie dye tank tops I ordered from Depop finally arrived and I was excited because they feel CLASSIC like [Charli Damelio classic](https://www.tiktok.com/@charlidamelio/video/6896234993069067526?lang=en&sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6891999718790268421&is_from_webapp=1).
