According to [my sources](https://whimsysoul.com/how-i-got-10k-tiktok-followers-overnight-8-hacks-to-rapidly-grow-your-following-on-tiktok/), it's important to have a cute and fun bio to have a profile that "looks approachable & fun so you can earn more new followers who tap over to look at your profile." So, after a cursory search, I chose Jade's first TikTok bio off of [this list](https://www.elitedaily.com/p/24-clever-tiktok-bios-thatll-make-your-fans-followers-laugh-out-loud-19252291).

I chose: "glowing with the flow" from that list and added a bunch of emojis after (ðŸ’Žâœ¨ðŸ”®ðŸ’žðŸŒŸ) seeing as emojis are advised [here](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/optimize-tiktok-bio).

The bio still includes the URL of this site which I am pretty sure nobody has cared to look up yet.
