This sound makes me smile for real. It's so silly and fun. It's also not that popular yet, but I think it's so good that it will get popular, so I wanted to get in on it early.

I came up with this grand caption idea on my run this morning. I see a lot of successful TikTok's that expose someone's feelings when they're talking/flirting with/snapchatting/dating/breaking up with someone the like/love/used to love/etc.

Unlike other social media platforms, TikTok has really made itself a space that encourages creators to both show one's best self and one's (performed) inner self. There are so many "omg when a guy does this" or "can't resist when a girl does this, it's so hot" kind of videos. In middle and high school, this was the information I was constantly wondering about and would page through magazines like Seventeen looking for. Now, having so many different points of views hurled at me with just a swipe of my thumb, I wonder if I would feel I knew more or less about the inner workings of others' desire?

Anyway, TikTok is also about writing what will get views and not what's true. Jade and I both know this feeling, so I guess it's kind of true. Feels embarassing to admit. But worth it if people like it.
