This guy is such a good dancer and this choreo was probably the hardest I've learned yet. I had to film this later in the day so it was kind of dark outside. And bad lighting, I'm realizing, tends to correlate with unpopular videos.

It's hard to find an angle to film a dance where your phone can rest in a safe position and the lighting is good AND you can see most of your upper body for a dance.

The guy commented on the video which was sweet.

TikTok feels like we're all just on a hamster wheel sometimes, running as fast as we can. I wonder how it feels to have some random stranger out there doing your lil choreography. It seems like getting Charli to do your dance is the ultimate TikTok dance creator reward. @shaunyboii even seemed glad Jade did it though.
