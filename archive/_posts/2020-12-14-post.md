Dueting is one of my favorite features on TikTok. As a dancer, it feels so special to be able to quickly and easily choreograph something fun and have you dancing with yourself. I'm always impressed how the app has made it so easy... this kind of thing would have thrown me for a loop when I was back using iMovie in middle school.

It was fun coming up with moments to try and have these two characters "interact" while dancing, but simultaneously really difficult to keep track of both of their choreography in my head at once. Muscle memory kept me wanting to do the original dance even when I was filming the second one.

I was disappointed, though, that this video (at least right now) has like the least views ever. To me, it's got more visual candy than most of Jade's other videos. But, since she's wearing a full sweatsuit here, maybe her mostly male followers are uninterested?

Frustrating that after putting a little bit of creative work into a video like this, Jade would be met with a response that was way less enthusiastic compared to a video of her in a bra top lip syncing lyrics.
