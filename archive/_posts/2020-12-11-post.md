Rewatching this video after posting it, the phrase _thirst trap_ just is yelled over and over in my brain. I was trying really hard on that first shot to make it look like I have some semblance of abs and was so distracted by that task that the camera work with the fingers turned out pretty bad.

This trend falls into a category of videos that I have personally labeled "surprise! I'm hot." They always start with some suspenseful clips(s) that don't quite reveal how the creator actually looks. But then, they end on a big reveal where the audience sees that the person filming it is indeed well above average attractiveness. It surprises and satisfies. A perfect TikTok video recipe.

This is also the first time I'm showcasing Jade's phone case in the mirror. It's a [Wildflower case](https://www.instagram.com/wildflowercases/) just like [all the influencers have](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/wildflower-phone-cases-bella-hadid-mirror-selfies): "From Dua Lipa and Bella Hadid to Emma Chamberlain and Addison Rae, if you pause TikTok at the right moment and look for the details, you'll find Wildflower's signature soft girl and e-girl-approved designs."
