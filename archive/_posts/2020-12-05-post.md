I filmed [another draft of this dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_sv8ZbLAmI) that I actually like a lot more, but didn't end up posting that one because, after watching it back, I felt I was getting too into the dance and too out of Jade's character. It's closer to how I would move as myself, which just doesn't feel right to impose onto Jade. For me, this brought up the question: is Jade a dancer? Currently, she can move decently well, but isn't focusing on dance as her main thing. On some level, I feel like moving her toward the ~ dance ~ space would conflate my own craving for dance validation with Jade's specific aspirations. And Jade's specific aspirations resemble the rest of "[straight TikTok](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=straight%20tiktok)." _The Atlantic_'s [description of the Hype House](theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/charli-damelio-tiktok-teens/616929/) illustrates this well: "The group’s relentlessly viral posts helped establish the aesthetic of straight TikTok—young, pretty, mostly white people dancing."

Young, pretty, mostly white people dancing. That's the kind of content Jade consumes, aspires to, and eventually regurgitates onto the platform. (She's uhhh half white, so "mostly" isn't too far of a stretch?) But despite her efforts, the gap between her and the girls she sees in the Hype House continues to feel vast. She knows there is much work to be done.

One note on the way people reference "dancing" on TikTok. At least in English, we call [this](https://youtu.be/tjP8C-sT2ZU?t=15) "dancing", but we also call [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12nL4JUkS4c) "dancing." Clearly, the term encompasses many forms. And its free range makes itself known on TikTok too. Compared to some other TikTok dances, like [this one](https://www.tiktok.com/@jadeontheinternet/video/6901763623799033093?sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6891999718790268421&is_from_webapp=1), [this one](https://www.tiktok.com/@jadeontheinternet/video/6897286042689260805?sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6891999718790268421&is_from_webapp=1), and [this one](https://www.tiktok.com/@jadeontheinternet/video/6892467101504654598?sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6891999718790268421&is_from_webapp=1), today's dance by [Mahak Hamid](https://www.tiktok.com/@mahakhamidd) more closely resembles choreography. Granted, I already knew about half the moves and could still film this while standing between my bed and the closet which is about two feet of space, but I do love the musicality here and bit of flavor to the movement.
