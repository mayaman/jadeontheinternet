Viral content on the internet often operates based on an index of either its ~ wow factor ~ or its relatability. That's what memes are all about.

TikTok thrives on this kind of content. Videos of people exposing themselves or making a joke out of how they do something "embarrassing" often go viral because people love to feel like they can see themselves (and laugh about themselves) while using a creator's content on screen as a proxy.

Though I will say, my anxiety recently is REAL (especially since starting this project...), Jade putting this out there feels more like a gimmick. It reminds me of what Rob Horning points out in his [essay on TikTok's culture](https://reallifemag.com/i-write-the-songs/): "You can trace the gimmickry at the level of content, with how prominent all the memes are, or at the level of the interface, where users are offered some new way to process or produce content, whether that is zany image filters and AR lenses or algorithmic feeds."

Bottom line, this filter and Jade's constructed reaction are all transparent in their function and intent, yet still offer pleasure in consumption. Anxiety, we all know what that feels like to some extent, right? But how CRAZY that this filter picked it out for ME? With some serious suspension of disbelief, the "joke" is enough to get maybe a small laugh and maybe a like. Nobody cares that it's obviously a gimmick. They know.
