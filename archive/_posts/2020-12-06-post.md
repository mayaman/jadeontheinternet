When it comes time for me to film a TikTok, finding a good place to set up my phone always remains a significant challenge. It can't be too low or else my head is too high in the frame. It also can't be too high or you can't see the necessary details of the outfit I have carefully constructed for this moment. It has to be at an angle with optimal lighting. That usually means balancing it precariously against the glass on my bedroom window. A difficult task on any day, but TODAY my phone was dying and TikTok gets all glitchy when you try to film at sub 5% so I had to also make sure the phone could balance while remaining plugged into a charging cord.

All of this is to say, I clearly did not balance it carefully enough and right after I started filming this take it plunged down on to the window sill. I picked it up in horror, worried that it had been harmed, but luckily it survived unscathed.

I filmed plenty of fully normal takes of this dance, which has a differentiating alternative sugary sweet energy, but after showing this draft to my boyfriend he was like that's funny you should actually post that. Online, Jade has found plenty of advice that encourages her to "be creative" or more specifically, "[be unique and show people something they haven't seen before](https://thetab.com/uk/2020/01/17/how-to-get-tik-tok-famous-138720)," and this felt like a deviation from expectations. Jade felt hopeful in posting it, people would find her to be more relatable, a little silly, and actively "keeping it real."

The video did end up doing pretty well compared to her other videos. It's currently at 324 likes, which is by far the most she's ever had on a video to date.
