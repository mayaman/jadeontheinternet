Articles online also emphasize that you should jump! on! trends! but "[with a twist](https://whimsysoul.com/how-i-got-10k-tiktok-followers-overnight-8-hacks-to-rapidly-grow-your-following-on-tiktok/)." Well, I was having a hard time coming up with a good twist to pull on this sound because most of the videos used the premise of boys always hitting on them/checking them out/DMing them/etc and anything in that direction felt TIRED, but then! [this sound](https://www.tiktok.com/music/busy-doin-hot-girl-ish-6895193576767081218?lang=en) was stuck in my head on loop and I was like, would it be CUTE to reference it here?

Anyway, honestly, watching it back, it's a bit of a stretch of a joke. [@weleftdamfpercsatgrammas](https://www.tiktok.com/@weleftdamfpercsatgrammas) commented, "I don't get it" and I truly don't blame them. Yet somehow, this video already has MORE views than yesterday's video, but way less likes? Still confused about the algorithm.

In other news, I am officially out of control ADDICTED to TikTok. The fact that Jade's past couple of videos have gotten more views/likes than usual has made it even more alluring. It's just like when I posted on Instagram, with my pulling down to refresh my likes constantly, except even more sticky because TikTok constantly teases the potential of virality. Once a post starts gaining traction, I'm like, is this it? Is this Jade's big break? A thought that both excites and terrifies me simultaneously.

Jade and I are closely tethered in this way. Our hopes and dreams wrapped up in this algorithm for ostensibly different reasons, but in actuality are the reasons that different? How is being an artist, an editor, or a performer, working for success any more respectable than an influencer working for the same thing? An influencer's desire for fame is often laid bare, embedded into their pursuit from the start. Might that kind of admittance actually be more admirable than an artist's attempt to disguise the same truth?
