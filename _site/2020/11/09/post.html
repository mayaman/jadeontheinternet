        <!-- <p>Let‚Äôs talk about the dolphin bunny dance. If you are not on TikTok, maybe you don‚Äôt know what I am talking about.

I was just laughing out loud watching all of those videos).</p>

<p>Although social media YouTube queen Emma Chamberlain has said, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@emmachamberlain/video/6869187997728771333?lang=en&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;sender_web_id=6891999718790268421&amp;is_from_webapp=1">let‚Äôs never do that again</a>,‚Äù it still lives on in many forms. Even if just for a small few seconds in a dance sequence, like in this video. I had to try to do it so many times because when I was first trying I looked unbelievably awkward. PLUS, the focus of this dance is especially on people who have like nice, hot butts, which I do not. I have nothing. Because I felt like I could never get it quite right, I filmed a total of 22 drafts of this post. I put just four iterations here so you can see some of the process. Watching them back, they are look mostly the same to me and it‚Äôs surprising how self-critical I get while filming them.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p><strong>DRAFT 1:</strong>
I decided the hop was weird in this one‚Ä¶</p>

<p>*</p>

<p><strong>DRAFT 2:</strong>
Halfway through filming, I must have decided this was a bad run, so was just joking around the second half of the dance. This feels way truer to how I would film a TikTok as me, Maya.</p>

<p><strong>DRAFT 3:</strong>
Second dolphin hop was WEAK.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p><strong>DRAFT 4:</strong>
Still, weak dolphin. After a lot of these, I moved on to doing the dolphin hop in a more side to side rolly way which is in the main video. Maybe I should actually watch those tutorials I linked at the top and practice. And keep in mind, these are just 4 of 22 (!!) drafts I filmed for this post.</p>
