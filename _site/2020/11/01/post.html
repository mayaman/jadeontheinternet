            <p>Being a trained dancer with 13+ years of experience, I figured learning these quick TikTok dances would be trivial. Like they should have already downloaded to my brain just by watching them so many times. But, I am here to tell you that was not the case!! I mean the dances don’t take thaaaat long to learn (especially compared to the type of choreography I’m used to when I take classes at studios in New York), but they definitely do require me to set aside some time to focus and drill the moves.</p>

<p>And the moves! TikTok has really spawned this new genre of “dance” that, as Jon Caramanica points out in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/10/arts/TIK-TOK.html">his TikTok analysis</a>, essentially reduces people to “human GIFs.” I feel like the choreography is created more as a ~ moving selfie ~ rather than a full out dance routine… <a href="https://observer.com/2020/01/tiktok-dance-moves-choreography-history/">Charlotte Barnett puts it well</a>: “Feet—traditionally fairly integral to the notion of dance—have lost significance in this genre of choreography created by teens with access to only a stationary camera. Here, all movement is confined by the need to stay in front of an iPhone front-facing camera that is probably propped up by a stack of books on a bathroom or kitchen countertop.” I did this post’s dance in the small space between the end of my bed and the closet (maybe about two and a half feet wide) facing my iPhone which was precariously balanced on the window pane.</p>

<p>Even though this whole genre of dance is… untraditional… I still definitely enjoyed learning this and doing it to the catchy Marina and the Diamond’s sound. This one specifically feels very cheerleader and cutsey. I had to remind myself to smile and do something nice with my face while I was recording it. It’s easy to forget because there’s no audience when you’re filming in the moment, only the potential of one in the future.</p>
