        <p>Okay so it is clearly election day here in the U.S. but going on Jadeâ€™s TikTok account you would barely know it! Some of this is skewed by TikTokâ€™s algorithm which surfaces older content, but also lots of people she follows are posting as usual, so I guess Jade is going to too (my absentee ballot in PA was received though donâ€™t worry).</p>

<p>Had a rare long car ride planned today and I was excited to have the chance to film some in-car content to distance Jade from feeling like she lived in a city. Lots of people seem to post videos in their car, both moving and stationary. It gives any video a very casual, filmed this quick on the go kind of feel. I always thought that these videos also tend to appear pretty unrehearsed. And maybe some peopleâ€™s are! But trying to do one of these lip syncing videos for the first time I got very caught up and probably filmed 17 plus takes until I felt I had something passable to post. It was laborious. Painful, even. My pinky finger started cramping up from holding the iPhone. I was doing this, mouthing these words, holding my phone up to my face for probably over an hour total.</p>

<p>After I felt I had filmed enough drafts, I went through each one trying to see it from my potential audienceâ€™s POV and asked myself <em>Does this look casual? Do I look anywhere near as alluring as those other girls who Iâ€™ve seen do this exact same lip syncing?</em> I landed on this one I think because it involved the least movement and I managed to look away from the cameras at certain moments to appear more ~mysterious~ like who is she looking at over there.</p>

<p>Before, every time I would watch someone do one of these lip syncing videos, I would think to myself nice, cute, obviously I could also do that if I wanted to. This proved to be an unexpected challengeâ€¦ hoping my efficiency in producing these will improve as time goes on and I get more used to filming them?</p>
