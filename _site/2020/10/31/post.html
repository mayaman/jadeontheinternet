        <p>Okay! Before we get started I have a few notes on form because this is the first post of many to come‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I want this space here on <a href="https://whoisjadeontheinter.net/">whoisjadeontheinter.net</a> to feel like the kind of personal blog you used to find on the online: candid, ameteur, meant for just a handful of people, and kind of TMI. This website is hand coded by me in straight up HTML, CSS, and Javascript (I do a lot of web development with other fancy frameworks and whatever, but it felt right (<a href="https://coolguy.website/writing/basic-html-is-the-new-punk-folk-explosion.html">and punk</a>) to build this site in this homemade way with very few dependencies). I‚Äôll be uploading a post like this one with every new post that is uploaded to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jadeontheinternet">@jadeontheinternet</a>‚Äôs TikTok account to unpack the process and my current thoughts. These mini blog posts are not well planned essays or deep researched analyses, but instead a kind of honest ‚Äúbehind the scenes‚Äù look into the process of the performance‚Äôs upkeep. Expect half baked thoughts, typos, and run on sentences‚Ä¶ really leaning into the ‚Äú<a href="https://suddenly.rocks/pdfs/jones-once-its-typed-its-published.pdf">Once it‚Äôs typed, it‚Äôs published</a>‚Äù mindset both for my own sanity and for the project‚Äôs goal of transparency.</p>

<p>Each post here will include a link to the corresponding TikTok post as well as the video embedded via YouTube (the embed is much easier to watch compared to the TikTok embed AND who knows what will happen to this precious data if TikTok is banned/handed over elsewhere?!). The post will also include some references to similar posts that relate to the one Jade creates (see below) in an attempt to trace inspiration and document trends on the app. Again, Jade is not a mirror of any one person, but instead an amalgamation of perceived trends.</p>

<p>There are also some numbers I‚Äôll share each time. The glossy, aesthetically aware images Jade produces are impossible to create without a combination of specific things. I think it is important to be clear that producing these images requires these things (makeup, accessories, clothing, etc.) and buying these things requires money and therefore producing these images requires money. I am going to be as rigorous as possible in documenting what I purchase for Jade that visibly affects her image that ends up on screen. Money spent on these things will be continually aggregated under ‚ÄúTotal money spent‚Äù on each post. Also, we all know, lots of successful influencers eventually actually make money by posting on TikTok. While I don‚Äôt really expect that to happen, if it ever does, it will be documented under ‚ÄúTotal money made.‚Äù</p>

<p>Aaaaand lastly, followers and likes. The two big numbers displayed at the top of each TikTok profile (besides ‚ÄúFollowing‚Äù (the number of people you follow), which unlike the other two, is self enacted). These numbers are social currency and I want to diligently track how and when they evolve.</p>

<p>Yeah, so I honestly HONESTLY really don‚Äôt know what to expect. But this project feels important to me. And I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it, so I had to bring it to life. If you‚Äôre reading this (weird!), thanks for joining for a piece of Jade‚Äôs journey. Here we go for real now on to our regular programming &lt;3</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>After dreaming up this project over the past couple of months, it was surprisingly anticlimactic to actually post this to TikTok. I wanted Jade‚Äôs first video to be a ~ transition video ~ to mark the day that I transitioned into Jade online. This audio is pretty silly on the surface, but also speaks more deeply to what I plan to explore throughout this performance. How are ‚Äúugly‚Äù versus ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù personas constructed online?</p>

<p>Before filming this, I went shopping to buy some makeup for Jade. After watching a lot of ‚Äúeveryday makeup‚Äù routines (and being shocked by the effort that goes into these daily processes), I decided to start with what I perceived to be the absolute necessities‚Ä¶ I figured I can always grow from there. In the first half of this video I am wearing no makeup and had quite literally just woken up. In the second half of this video, I‚Äôm wearing concealer, mascara (after aggressively curling my very straight, Asian eyelashes), highlighter, blush, and lip gloss. I‚Äôm also standing on the ledge of a window sill in my apartment, squishing myself up against the glass in an attempt to catch some good lighting. The video has the G6 filter applied at 50 (I think that means like 50%? Not totally sure). I‚Äôve <a href="https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2020/02/06/how-to-get-the-g6-filter-on-tiktok-and-why-we-love-it/">read that</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@naomigenes/video/6806263179375594758">G6 is THE FILTER</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSQZTvjSOwA">to use</a>.</p>

<p>Going through this process, I tried to really think about why performing Jade made me, Maya, so uncomfortable. Who is Jade on the Internet? Here, she is making a video where she explicitly positions herself as exemplary of ‚Äúthe opposite of ugly‚Äù and posts it to the Internet to see how the general TikTok audience responds. She is both asserting her own attractiveness and testing it at the same time. She did not make this video for herself. She made it for you, an amorphous, blurry, genderless YOU who she hopes will see it, like it, and confirm for her that indeed, when she labors to achieve her ‚Äúmoment,‚Äù she is not ugly (she‚Äôs only ugly when in bed pre-beauty labor). It‚Äôs a joke! But it‚Äôs also whispering, it‚Äôs truuuuuueeeee, beauty does matter.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think this makes me uncomfortable because I have long worked to distance myself from being perceived as asking for this kind of validation online. I see the way that people categorize this ‚Äútype of girl‚Äù in their minds. They think she‚Äôs ditzy, desperate, and self-obsessed. Already, I can tell you that Jade is none of those things. She understands the mechanics of social media better than anyone else. She‚Äôs capitalizing on its built in reward systems. Like many womxn, she has grown up CONSTANTLY trying to picture herself in the eyes of other people. Social media, in this performance TikTok specifically, is a platform where she can render an ideal version of the self she is continually performing anyway.</p>
