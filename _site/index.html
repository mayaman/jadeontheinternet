            <p>This is from deep in the drafts. Filmed this upstate on the same day I was wearing this sweatshirt in the dance videos I posted before. People seem to acknowledge when a video is a draft in the caption, so I hashtagged it #draft. Feels like that’s meant to lower expectations or excuse a video being less polished.</p>

<p>This audio is really sweet. Feels like something I would send to my friends :-). Lots of the videos girls have posted tend to have a ~ hippie vibe ~ so I thought this flowery sweatshirt might be fitting.</p>

<p>Found the words really tough to memorize it takes a while. You can see I’m kind of off at the end.</p>

<p>Also, I am truly not sure how I got to use this Color Customizer effect. I think I got here from someone else’s video, but I didn’t choose this specific color setting it just appeared. But thought it was kind of nice so I kept it.</p>

            <p>I was hanging out at my parents’ apartment with Chella and MaryV and MaryV said she would do Jade’s hair and makeup for a post. So far, I’ve been kind of telling myself that I’m not sure what else I could do right now to make Jade look more different than me, but MaryV straightening my hair made me realize that I need to focus more on how I can bring Jade to the next level and continue to differentiate her image from my day to day one.</p>

<p>This trend is really cute. But it is hard to zoom and deal with winking all at the same time. I am confused if people are actually pinching to zoom to do this or if there is some effect or way to set it up to do it automatically that I don’t know about?</p>

<p><strong>DRAFT 1:</strong>
This was me practicing and I could not figure out how this Face Zoom effect worked at ALL. Decided I would not be using it.</p>

Still trash at these head turn transitions. I forgot to set the timer in this one!!! Maybe will incorporate another time…</p>

This angle was cool but zooming was very unsmooth.</p>

            <p>I could not believe it when I first saw this trend on my for you page. So many people are using this sound to film videos of themselves and then ask the general TikTok user population if they look “pretty, average, or ugly” at first glance?????? Check out the references to see just a small subset of existing examples. Added a few more than usual here because I think it’s important to see how many people (especially girls) have so desperately wanted to see themselves through the eyes of another that they would opt to make themselves vulnerable to the particular ruthlessness of strangers on the Internet.</p>

<p>This trend is fucked up on so many levels. Watching it I want to hug every person posting a video like this and be like DON’T YOU DARE LISTEN TO THESE COMMENTS DID YOU LOOK AT THIS HATER’S PAGE THEY REPOST SHADY CONTENT AND TBH I THINK THEY ARE A FAKE ACCOUNT. Also, so many people in the comments would say things like “so much potential!!! Just try x, y, or z.” Sometimes their suggestions are pretty simple like a middle part, but sometimes they are like fake eyelashes or worse a GYM. It’s this kind of distilled cruelty that can only exist screen to screen and nobody would ever dare shout out IRL.</p>

<p>I struggled beforehand deciding whether or not I wanted to contribute for a couple reasons. First, I did not want to encourage other people to do the trend or endorse it in any way. And second, I was legitimately scared of the kinds of comments that Jade would receive because at the end of the day, Jade’s face is MY FACE. Ultimately though, Jade would want to know what would happen if she posted this (and so would I), and I could not imagine what someone could say that would actually cut me too deep. I do still feel extremely uncomfortable that seeing this could prompt someone else to do the same…</p>

<p>I at first tried to film this without transitions, but lots of people were doing these head turn transitions and they felt important so I eventually incorporated that which is NOT as easy as it looks. Because you not only have to turn your head at the right times and in the right directions, but you also have to make sure that you set the timer to start/stop filming ahead of time to be able to capture the right clip without having to click the recording button. It’s complex, trust me.</p>

<p>After filming a sequence, I would watch it back and try to imagine I was seeing it from a stranger’s perspective. Inevitably I wondered, will they think I’m pretty? Even though going through this ritual I am constantly consciously acknowledging it is ridiculous and should not exist, there is STILL a part of me that hopes someone out there online will say, yes indeed you are pretty you did it!</p>

<p>As I’m writing these words, this is already by far my most viewed video at 5427 views in three hours. (My most watched video before that has a humble 262 views and that was over 10 days ago.) The comment section is pretty active. Lots of people say “average” some even say “below average” and yeah some say pretty, but let me tell you, 13 year old me would read the comment “Average basically maybe even a little below, no hate, just my opinion, and she asked us to rate her so don’t get mad y’all.” and think about that every day for a while.</p>

<p>I took a total of 18 drafts of this one, putting three here.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p><strong>DRAFT 1:</strong>
Tried to do the “I am chilling in my bed” angle, but did not think it was really working for me.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p><strong>DRAFT 2:</strong>
This is another option of text I considered using. The majority of the videos on this trend say something like “pretty, average, or ugly?” Thinking about it though I felt better about not encouraging anyone else to comment “ugly!” and also not promoting more people to post videos with that as a multiple choice option.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p><strong>DRAFT 3:</strong>
This is after I decided to try to do the head turn thing and forgot to set the timer to stop the video at the right time, so it kept going.</p>

            <p>I already knew the words to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NKmLkAU3NM">this song</a>, so figured it’d be quick to film after the two dance posts I’d filmed in this outfit. Apparently I should never repeat an outfit if I’m the real deal. Had to get one more in with this pink tie dye.</p>

<p>You can see my strategic hand placement because I had a weird scab by my lip that I am trying to cover up. The filter does a lot of the work.</p>

<p>Also the ~bling bling~ is so fun!! I love how it sparkles right at the end when I look up. This is one of the few effects that seems to be chill and normal to use often.</p>

I spent so long learning and then filming so many drafts of yesterday’s dance I had to get back to doing some real work so didn’t want to take the time to re-learn another new dance and decided to just re-do this one. I often see big influencers redo the same dance multiple times. But it seems like maybe twice is kind of the limit?</p>

            <p>Let’s talk about the dolphin bunny dance. If you are not on TikTok, maybe you don’t know what I am talking about. But if you ARE on TikTok I would be shocked if you are not yet intimately familiar with this “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ff5DySIKcE">super popular dance move</a>.” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO6-c-CgXew">One instructional video</a> even says “you need to know it in life.” I also recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoChrf7oWQo">this video</a> as a primer (Honestly, I think the dolphin dance is hilarious. I was just laughing out loud watching all of those videos).</p>

<p>Although social media YouTube queen Emma Chamberlain has said, “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@emmachamberlain/video/6869187997728771333?lang=en&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;sender_web_id=6891999718790268421&amp;is_from_webapp=1">let’s never do that again</a>,” it still lives on in many forms. Even if just for a small few seconds in a dance sequence, like in this video. I had to try to do it so many times because when I was first trying I looked unbelievably awkward. PLUS, the focus of this dance is especially on people who have like nice, hot butts, which I do not. I have nothing. Because I felt like I could never get it quite right, I filmed a total of 22 drafts of this post. I put just four iterations here so you can see some of the process. Watching them back, they are look mostly the same to me and it’s surprising how self-critical I get while filming them.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p><strong>DRAFT 1:</strong>
I decided the hop was weird in this one…</p>

<p>*</p>

<p><strong>DRAFT 2:</strong>
Halfway through filming, I must have decided this was a bad run, so was just joking around the second half of the dance. This feels way truer to how I would film a TikTok as me, Maya.</p>

<p><strong>DRAFT 3:</strong>
Second dolphin hop was WEAK.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p><strong>DRAFT 4:</strong>
Still, weak dolphin. After a lot of these, I moved on to doing the dolphin hop in a more side to side rolly way which is in the main video. Maybe I should actually watch those tutorials I linked at the top and practice. And keep in mind, these are just 4 of 22 (!!) drafts I filmed for this post.</p>

            <p>Today it was announced that Joe Biden/Kamala Harris won the election and the whole city of New York erupted in cheers and I spent most of the day dancing in the streets, but I took a quick break to film this dance in my apartment. I was feeling so elated I had to rewrite this caption like three times because I wanted to shout about Donald Trump being kicked out of office, but Jade, following most of the videos she saw posted in the hours after it was announced, was uninterested in directly referencing the election. Politics are out of her current world scope.</p>

<p>This is her first caption question she asks her imagined audience. Curious if anyone will respond about what is making them smile. She only has 22 followers right now and pretty sure a handful of those are fake accounts…</p>

            <p>I skimmed through some articles talking about how to gain followers on TikTok. I want to try taking some of their advice more seriously a bit later in the project (curious how things grow more organically to start), but I did decide to try one tip they had about <a href="https://whimsysoul.com/how-i-got-10k-tiktok-followers-overnight-8-hacks-to-rapidly-grow-your-following-on-tiktok/">trending hashtags</a> that actually helped me make sense of why I see so many people using the same seemingly random hashtags.</p>

<p>So the ones that popped up for me were #RedBullDanceYourStyle #MyRecommendation and I added those instead of my usual #foryou type of ones. Returning to this a few days after it was posted though it seems to be doing the worst of any video I have posted so far. Not sure if that is hashtag related or not. Will continue to experiment.</p>

<p>ALSO this song is so sexual? I remember hearing it in 5th grade and having no idea what it actually meant and now I wonder how many younger people on TikTok also do not know what they are really talking about here.</p>

<p>I put on Jade’s makeup for this one, but it was nice to have her also hop on the <a href="https://www.shape.com/lifestyle/fashion/oversized-sweatshirt-tiktok">oversized sweatshirt TikTok trend</a>. She’s also wearing lululemon leggings (a TikTok favorite fashion brand apparently). Outfit is nice and comfy. It’s funny how so many people wear this comfy lounge wear to film videos while still getting all made up from the neck up.</p>

<p>Filmed this in a spare bedroom at a friend’s Airbnb upstate. I hope her location changes are disorienting. But also maybe nobody will ever notice… These videos aren’t at all about where she is, just what she’s doing.</p>

            <p>Again, this took an embarrassing number of takes. Tried to look all luscious while I sofly informed my viewer that I have been “secretly banging” their homeboy. I absolutely love this song by SZA, but it’s interesting that this audio snippet rose to fame. Think maybe it’s because it puts the viewer in the position of imagining the person saying this has lots of sexy secrets???</p>

<p>This sound especially I can not imagine myself using because I actively try to distance myself from implying that someone watching me on their screen should find me ~ sexy ~ in a direct way. I never want them to think I am asking for that attention. So doing this I had to shed my internalized embarrassment (something to unpack later…) and whisper these words to my phone camera in the passenger seat of the car.</p>

            <p>Okay so it is clearly election day here in the U.S. but going on Jade’s TikTok account you would barely know it! Some of this is skewed by TikTok’s algorithm which surfaces older content, but also lots of people she follows are posting as usual, so I guess Jade is going to too (my absentee ballot in PA was received though don’t worry).</p>

<p>Had a rare long car ride planned today and I was excited to have the chance to film some in-car content to distance Jade from feeling like she lived in a city. Lots of people seem to post videos in their car, both moving and stationary. It gives any video a very casual, filmed this quick on the go kind of feel. I always thought that these videos also tend to appear pretty unrehearsed. And maybe some people’s are! But trying to do one of these lip syncing videos for the first time I got very caught up and probably filmed 17 plus takes until I felt I had something passable to post. It was laborious. Painful, even. My pinky finger started cramping up from holding the iPhone. I was doing this, mouthing these words, holding my phone up to my face for probably over an hour total.</p>

<p>After I felt I had filmed enough drafts, I went through each one trying to see it from my potential audience’s POV and asked myself <em>Does this look casual? Do I look anywhere near as alluring as those other girls who I’ve seen do this exact same lip syncing?</em> I landed on this one I think because it involved the least movement and I managed to look away from the cameras at certain moments to appear more ~mysterious~ like who is she looking at over there.</p>

<p>Before, every time I would watch someone do one of these lip syncing videos, I would think to myself nice, cute, obviously I could also do that if I wanted to. This proved to be an unexpected challenge… hoping my efficiency in producing these will improve as time goes on and I get more used to filming them?</p>

            <p>Being a trained dancer with 13+ years of experience, I figured learning these quick TikTok dances would be trivial. Like they should have already downloaded to my brain just by watching them so many times. But, I am here to tell you that was not the case!! I mean the dances don’t take thaaaat long to learn (especially compared to the type of choreography I’m used to when I take classes at studios in New York), but they definitely do require me to set aside some time to focus and drill the moves.</p>

<p>And the moves! TikTok has really spawned this new genre of “dance” that, as Jon Caramanica points out in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/10/arts/TIK-TOK.html">his TikTok analysis</a>, essentially reduces people to “human GIFs.” I feel like the choreography is created more as a ~ moving selfie ~ rather than a full out dance routine… <a href="https://observer.com/2020/01/tiktok-dance-moves-choreography-history/">Charlotte Barnett puts it well</a>: “Feet—traditionally fairly integral to the notion of dance—have lost significance in this genre of choreography created by teens with access to only a stationary camera. Here, all movement is confined by the need to stay in front of an iPhone front-facing camera that is probably propped up by a stack of books on a bathroom or kitchen countertop.” I did this post’s dance in the small space between the end of my bed and the closet (maybe about two and a half feet wide) facing my iPhone which was precariously balanced on the window pane.</p>

<p>Even though this whole genre of dance is… untraditional… I still definitely enjoyed learning this and doing it to the catchy Marina and the Diamond’s sound. This one specifically feels very cheerleader and cutsey. I had to remind myself to smile and do something nice with my face while I was recording it. It’s easy to forget because there’s no audience when you’re filming in the moment, only the potential of one in the future.</p>

            <p>Being a trained dancer with 13+ years of experience, I figured learning these quick TikTok dances would be trivial. Like they should have already downloaded to my brain just by watching them so many times. But, I am here to tell you that was not the case!! I mean the dances don’t take thaaaat long to learn (especially compared to the type of choreography I’m used to when I take classes at studios in New York), but they definitely do require me to set aside some time to focus and drill the moves.</p>

<p>And the moves! TikTok has really spawned this new genre of “dance” that, as Jon Caramanica points out in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/10/arts/TIK-TOK.html">his TikTok analysis</a>, essentially reduces people to “human GIFs.” I feel like the choreography is created more as a ~ moving selfie ~ rather than a full out dance routine… <a href="https://observer.com/2020/01/tiktok-dance-moves-choreography-history/">Charlotte Barnett puts it well</a>: “Feet—traditionally fairly integral to the notion of dance—have lost significance in this genre of choreography created by teens with access to only a stationary camera. Here, all movement is confined by the need to stay in front of an iPhone front-facing camera that is probably propped up by a stack of books on a bathroom or kitchen countertop.” I did this post’s dance in the small space between the end of my bed and the closet (maybe about two and a half feet wide) facing my iPhone which was precariously balanced on the window pane.</p>

<p>Even though this whole genre of dance is… untraditional… I still definitely enjoyed learning this and doing it to the catchy Marina and the Diamond’s sound. This one specifically feels very cheerleader and cutsey. I had to remind myself to smile and do something nice with my face while I was recording it.

            <p>Okay! Before we get started I have a few notes on form because this is the first post of many to come…</p>

<p>I want this space here on <a href="https://whoisjadeontheinter.net/">whoisjadeontheinter.net</a> to feel like the kind of personal blog you used to find on the online: candid, ameteur, meant for just a handful of people, and kind of TMI. This website is hand coded by me in straight up HTML, CSS, and Javascript (I do a lot of web development with other fancy frameworks and whatever, but it felt right (<a href="https://coolguy.website/writing/basic-html-is-the-new-punk-folk-explosion.html">and punk</a>) to build this site in this homemade way with very few dependencies). I’ll be uploading a post like this one with every new post that is uploaded to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jadeontheinternet">@jadeontheinternet</a>’s TikTok account to unpack the process and my current thoughts. These mini blog posts are not well planned essays or deep researched analyses, but instead a kind of honest “behind the scenes” look into the process of the performance’s upkeep. Expect half baked thoughts, typos, and run on sentences… really leaning into the “<a href="https://suddenly.rocks/pdfs/jones-once-its-typed-its-published.pdf">Once it’s typed, it’s published</a>” mindset both for my own sanity and for the project’s goal of transparency.</p>

<p>Each post here will include a link to the corresponding TikTok post as well as the video embedded via YouTube (the embed is much easier to watch compared to the TikTok embed AND who knows what will happen to this precious data if TikTok is banned/handed over elsewhere?!). The post will also include some references to similar posts that relate to the one Jade creates (see below) in an attempt to trace inspiration and document trends on the app. Again, Jade is not a mirror of any one person, but instead an amalgamation of perceived trends.</p>

<p>There are also some numbers I’ll share each time. The glossy, aesthetically aware images Jade produces are impossible to create without a combination of specific things. I think it is important to be clear that producing these images requires these things (makeup, accessories, clothing, etc.) and buying these things requires money and therefore producing these images requires money. I am going to be as rigorous as possible in documenting what I purchase for Jade that visibly affects her image that ends up on screen. Money spent on these things will be continually aggregated under “Total money spent” on each post. Also, we all know, lots of successful influencers eventually actually make money by posting on TikTok. While I don’t really expect that to happen, if it ever does, it will be documented under “Total money made.”</p>

<p>Aaaaand lastly, followers and likes. The two big numbers displayed at the top of each TikTok profile (besides “Following” (the number of people you follow), which unlike the other two, is self enacted). These numbers are social currency and I want to diligently track how and when they evolve.</p>

<p>Yeah, so I honestly HONESTLY really don’t know what to expect. But this project feels important to me. And I couldn’t stop thinking about it, so I had to bring it to life. If you’re reading this (weird!), thanks for joining for a piece of Jade’s journey. Here we go for real now on to our regular programming &lt;3</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>After dreaming up this project over the past couple of months, it was surprisingly anticlimactic to actually post this to TikTok. I wanted Jade’s first video to be a ~ transition video ~ to mark the day that I transitioned into Jade online. This audio is pretty silly on the surface, but also speaks more deeply to what I plan to explore throughout this performance. How are “ugly” versus “beautiful” personas constructed online?</p>

<p>Before filming this, I went shopping to buy some makeup for Jade. After watching a lot of “everyday makeup” routines (and being shocked by the effort that goes into these daily processes), I decided to start with what I perceived to be the absolute necessities… I figured I can always grow from there. In the first half of this video I am wearing no makeup and had quite literally just woken up. In the second half of this video, I’m wearing concealer, mascara (after aggressively curling my very straight, Asian eyelashes), highlighter, blush, and lip gloss. I’m also standing on the ledge of a window sill in my apartment, squishing myself up against the glass in an attempt to catch some good lighting. The video has the G6 filter applied at 50 (I think that means like 50%? Not totally sure). I’ve <a href="https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2020/02/06/how-to-get-the-g6-filter-on-tiktok-and-why-we-love-it/">read that</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@naomigenes/video/6806263179375594758">G6 is THE FILTER</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSQZTvjSOwA">to use</a>.</p>

<p>Going through this process, I tried to really think about why performing Jade made me, Maya, so uncomfortable. Who is Jade on the Internet? Here, she is making a video where she explicitly positions herself as exemplary of “the opposite of ugly” and posts it to the Internet to see how the general TikTok audience responds. She is both asserting her own attractiveness and testing it at the same time. She did not make this video for herself. She made it for you, an amorphous, blurry, genderless YOU who she hopes will see it, like it, and confirm for her that indeed, when she labors to achieve her “moment,” she is not ugly (she’s only ugly when in bed pre-beauty labor). It’s a joke! But it’s also whispering, it’s truuuuuueeeee, beauty does matter.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think this makes me uncomfortable because I have long worked to distance myself from being perceived as asking for this kind of validation online. I see the way that people categorize this “type of girl” in their minds. They think she’s ditzy, desperate, and self-obsessed. Already, I can tell you that Jade is none of those things. She understands the mechanics of social media better than anyone else. She’s capitalizing on its built in reward systems. Like many womxn, she has grown up CONSTANTLY trying to picture herself in the eyes of other people. Social media, in this performance TikTok specifically, is a platform where she can render an ideal version of the self she is continually performing anyway.</p>

        <p>So, most of the people who use this sound WELL do this cool head turn transition at the end and show themselves from different points of view, but as I was filming this it was late and I had already spent so much time filming the previous two videos that I was too lazy to do the head turn thing so just went for a ZOOM IN.</p>

        <p>I was hanging out at my parents’ apartment with Chella and MaryV and MaryV said she would do Jade’s hair and makeup for a post. So far, I’ve been kind of telling myself that I’m not sure what else I could do right now to make Jade look more different than me, but MaryV straightening my hair made me realize that I need to focus more on how I can bring Jade to the next level and continue to differentiate her image from my day to day one.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2020/11/12/post.html">THIS TREND IS TOXIC</a></h2>
        <p>I could not believe it when I first saw this trend on my for you page. So many people are using this sound to film videos of themselves and then ask the general TikTok user population if they look “pretty, average, or ugly” at first glance?????? Check out the references to see just a small subset of existing examples. Added a few more than usual here because I think it’s important to see how many people (especially girls) have so desperately wanted to see themselves through the eyes of another that they would opt to make themselves vulnerable to the particular ruthlessness of strangers on the Internet.</p>

        <p>I already knew the words to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NKmLkAU3NM">this song</a>, so figured it’d be quick to film after the two dance posts I’d filmed in this outfit. Apparently I should never repeat an outfit if I’m the real deal. Had to get one more in with this pink tie dye.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2020/11/10/post.html">DANCE RE-DO</a></h2>
        <p>This already feels unbelievably time consuming. I spent so long learning and then filming so many drafts of yesterday’s dance I had to get back to doing some real work so didn’t want to take the time to re-learn another new dance and decided to just re-do this one. I often see big influencers redo the same dance multiple times. But it seems like maybe twice is kind of the limit?</p>

        <p>Let’s talk about the dolphin bunny dance. If you are not on TikTok, maybe you don’t know what I am talking about. But if you ARE on TikTok I would be shocked if you are not yet intimately familiar with this “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ff5DySIKcE">super popular dance move</a>.” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO6-c-CgXew">One instructional video</a> even says “you need to know it in life.” I also recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoChrf7oWQo">this video</a> as a primer (Honestly, I think the dolphin dance is hilarious. I was just laughing out loud watching all of those videos).</p>

        <p>This is for sure the first time I have ever put myself on the Internet with my middle finger in the air. I saw lots of girls captioning this post something like “just kidding” or “just for fun,” so “just for jokes” felt right. It strikes this strange balance between doing something “bad” and simultaneously apologizing/covering up for it.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2020/11/07/post.html">I AM SMILING ABOUT THE ELECTION BUT JADE IS SMILING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE</a></h2>
        <p>Today it was announced that Joe Biden/Kamala Harris won the election and the whole city of New York erupted in cheers and I spent most of the day dancing in the streets, but I took a quick break to film this dance in my apartment. I was feeling so elated I had to rewrite this caption like three times because I wanted to shout about Donald Trump being kicked out of office, but Jade, following most of the videos she saw posted in the hours after it was announced, was uninterested in directly referencing the election. Politics are out of her current world scope.</p>

        <p>I skimmed through some articles talking about how to gain followers on TikTok. I want to try taking some of their advice more seriously a bit later in the project (curious how things grow more organically to start), but I did decide to try one tip they had about <a href="https://whimsysoul.com/how-i-got-10k-tiktok-followers-overnight-8-hacks-to-rapidly-grow-your-following-on-tiktok/">trending hashtags</a> that actually helped me make sense of why I see so many people using the same seemingly random hashtags.</p>

        <p>Filmed six different drafts of this one. Was having a really hard time understanding how people’s butts could, like, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mikailadancer/video/6877363704157965574?sender_device=pc&amp;sender_web_id=6891999718790268421&amp;is_from_webapp=1">enter the frame on the “side to side” part</a> do not think I really succeeded in that.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2020/11/04/post.html">LET ME TELL YOU A SECRET</a></h2>
        <p>Again, this took an embarrassing number of takes. Tried to look all luscious while I sofly informed my viewer that I have been “secretly banging” their homeboy. I absolutely love this song by SZA, but it’s interesting that this audio snippet rose to fame. Think maybe it’s because it puts the viewer in the position of imagining the person saying this has lots of sexy secrets???</p>

        <p>Okay so it is clearly election day here in the U.S. but going on Jade’s TikTok account you would barely know it! Some of this is skewed by TikTok’s algorithm which surfaces older content, but also lots of people she follows are posting as usual, so I guess Jade is going to too (my absentee ballot in PA was received though don’t worry).</p>

        <h2><a href="/2020/11/01/post.html">FIRST DANCE ATTEMPT</a></h2>
        <p>Being a trained dancer with 13+ years of experience, I figured learning these quick TikTok dances would be trivial. Like they should have already downloaded to my brain just by watching them so many times. But, I am here to tell you that was not the case!! I mean the dances don’t take thaaaat long to learn (especially compared to the type of choreography I’m used to when I take classes at studios in New York), but they definitely do require me to set aside some time to focus and drill the moves.</p>
