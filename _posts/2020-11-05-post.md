Filmed six different drafts of this one. Was having a really hard time understanding how people’s butts could, like, [enter the frame on the “side to side” part](https://www.tiktok.com/@mikailadancer/video/6877363704157965574?sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6891999718790268421&is_from_webapp=1) do not think I really succeeded in that.

I put on Jade’s makeup for this one, but it was nice to have her also hop on the [oversized sweatshirt TikTok trend](https://www.shape.com/lifestyle/fashion/oversized-sweatshirt-tiktok). She’s also wearing lululemon leggings (a TikTok favorite fashion brand apparently). Outfit is nice and comfy. It’s funny how so many people wear this comfy lounge wear to film videos while still getting all made up from the neck up.

Filmed this in a spare bedroom at a friend’s Airbnb upstate. I hope her location changes are disorienting. But also maybe nobody will ever notice… These videos aren’t at all about where she is, just what she’s doing.
