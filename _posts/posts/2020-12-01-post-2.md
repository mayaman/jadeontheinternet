After a month of posting daily, Jade is upping her game. Read more about her specific game plan here. In line with the advice of many, Jade will sometimes now post not once, but twice (maybe even more times!) a day.

This post felt necessary to get out into the world today. It's been all over the "For You" page all day and is all about crafting and endearing/funny ending. Let me just say: fake falling for the camera is not! easy! I recommend checking out [this draft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu_kKhLWuV8) and [this draft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYDjUgsI6Sw) to see what I mean. I'm not even proud of this attempt, but I was tired to filming, so decided it would work. It helped that the words flashing in and out distract from the atrocity of the fall.
