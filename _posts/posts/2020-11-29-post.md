    caption: Hair got alllll messed up!!!

SO DIFFICULT TO EDIT THE TEXT. This whole video took me well over an hour to film and then edit all these words in the right place.

I had to keep re-filming at the beginning because I find it challenging to film a front-facing video in a way where my head is low enough on the screen that I can put words over top without covering my face.

It felt unethical to say Jade's genes are anything other than what they actually are, so this video's content is factual. The caption plays into a question "exotic" "ethnic" "flavorful" people like us always get, the _wait, so what are you?_ question. Here, Jade is capitalizing on people's curiousity for TikTok views by teasing the end reveal. Although classic European beauty standards seem to still strongly prevail on TikTok, appearing mixed race has generally become more trendy... you know it's true when the identity has been built into the biggest CGI influencer in the game, [Lil Miquela](https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/head/article/41436/1/mixed-race-identity-cgi-influencers-lil-miquela).

So, Jade is embracing her ~ [wasian](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Wasian) ~ (a term I only first heard on TikTok) identity in this video. Does that mean she never wishes she looked more like all of the blonde girls she follows? Absolutely not, but she's working with what she's got.
