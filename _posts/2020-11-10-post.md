This already feels unbelievably time consuming. I spent so long learning and then filming so many drafts of yesterday's dance I had to get back to doing some real work so didn't want to take the time to re-learn another new dance and decided to just re-do this one. I often see big influencers redo the same dance multiple times. But it seems like maybe twice is kind of the limit?
