Today it was announced that Joe Biden/Kamala Harris won the election and the whole city of New York erupted in cheers and I spent most of the day dancing in the streets, but I took a quick break to film this dance in my apartment. I was feeling so elated I had to rewrite this caption like three times because I wanted to shout about Donald Trump being kicked out of office, but Jade, following most of the videos she saw posted in the hours after it was announced, was uninterested in directly referencing the election. Politics are out of her current world scope.

This is her first caption question she asks her imagined audience. Curious if anyone will respond about what is making them smile. She only has 22 followers right now and pretty sure a handful of those are fake accounts...
