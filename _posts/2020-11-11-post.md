I already knew the words to [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NKmLkAU3NM), so figured it'd be quick to film after the two dance posts I'd filmed in this outfit. Apparently I should never repeat an outfit if I'm the real deal. Had to get one more in with this pink tie dye.

You can see my strategic hand placement because I had a weird scab by my lip that I am trying to cover up. The filter does a lot of the work.

Also the ~bling bling~ is so fun!! I love how it sparkles right at the end when I look up. This is one of the few effects that seems to be chill and normal to use often.
