I really debated about posting this because it breaks a rule I had set for myself in my head about not posting in the same outfit more than three times in a row.

But it was already dark here in New York once I got around to posting and I really didn't feel like filming another one, so decided to unleash this from the drafts.

Looking at other girls' videos to this sound, the theme really seems to be #selflove and #selfconfidence. It comes off as part comedy and also part instructional. The original sound is from an interview with Cardi B.
