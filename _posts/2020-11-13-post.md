I was hanging out at my parents' apartment with Chella and MaryV and MaryV said she would do Jade's hair and makeup for a post. So far, I've been kind of telling myself that I'm not sure what else I could do right now to make Jade look more different than me, but MaryV straightening my hair made me realize that I need to focus more on how I can bring Jade to the next level and continue to differentiate her image from my day to day one.

This trend is really cute. But it is hard to zoom and deal with winking all at the same time. I am confused if people are actually pinching to zoom to do this or if there is some effect or way to set it up to do it automatically that I don't know about?
