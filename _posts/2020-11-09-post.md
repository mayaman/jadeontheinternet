Let's talk about the dolphin bunny dance. If you are not on TikTok, maybe you don't know what I am talking about. But if you ARE on TikTok I would be shocked if you are not yet intimately familiar with this "[super popular dance move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ff5DySIKcE)." [One instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO6-c-CgXew) even says "you need to know it in life." I also recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoChrf7oWQo) as a primer (Honestly, I think the dolphin dance is hilarious. I was just laughing out loud watching all of those videos).

Although social media YouTube queen Emma Chamberlain has said, "[let's never do that again](https://www.tiktok.com/@emmachamberlain/video/6869187997728771333?lang=en&sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6891999718790268421&is_from_webapp=1)," it still lives on in many forms. Even if just for a small few seconds in a dance sequence, like in this video. I had to try to do it so many times because when I was first trying I looked unbelievably awkward. PLUS, the focus of this dance is especially on people who have like nice, hot butts, which I do not. I have nothing. Because I felt like I could never get it quite right, I filmed a total of 22 drafts of this post. I put just four iterations here so you can see some of the process. Watching them back, they are look mostly the same to me and it's surprising how self-critical I get while filming them.

**DRAFT 1:**
I decided the hop was weird in this one...

**DRAFT 2:**
Halfway through filming, I must have decided this was a bad run, so was just joking around the second half of the dance. This feels way truer to how I would film a TikTok as me, Maya.

**DRAFT 3:**
Second dolphin hop was WEAK.

**DRAFT 4:**
Still, weak dolphin. After a lot of these, I moved on to doing the dolphin hop in a more side to side rolly way which is in the main video. Maybe I should actually watch those tutorials I linked at the top and practice. And keep in mind, these are just 4 of 22 (!!) drafts I filmed for this post.
