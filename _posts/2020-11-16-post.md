This is from deep in the drafts. Filmed this upstate on the same day I was wearing this sweatshirt in the dance videos I posted before. People seem to acknowledge when a video is a draft in the caption, so I hashtagged it #draft. Feels like that's meant to lower expectations or excuse a video being less polished.

This audio is really sweet. Feels like something I would send to my friends :-). Lots of the videos girls have posted tend to have a ~ hippie vibe ~ so I thought this flowery sweatshirt might be fitting.

Found the words really tough to memorize it takes a while. You can see I'm kind of off at the end.

Also, I am truly not sure how I got to use this Color Customizer effect. I think I got here from someone else's video, but I didn't choose this specific color setting it just appeared. But thought it was kind of nice so I kept it.
