Being a trained dancer with 13+ years of experience, I figured learning these quick TikTok dances would be trivial. Like they should have already downloaded to my brain just by watching them so many times. But, I am here to tell you that was not the case!! I mean the dances don’t take thaaaat long to learn (especially compared to the type of choreography I’m used to when I take classes at studios in New York), but they definitely do require me to set aside some time to focus and drill the moves.

And the moves! TikTok has really spawned this new genre of “dance” that, as Jon Caramanica points out in [his TikTok analysis](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/10/arts/TIK-TOK.html), essentially reduces people to “human GIFs.” I feel like the choreography is created more as a ~ moving selfie ~ rather than a full out dance routine… [Charlotte Barnett puts it well](https://observer.com/2020/01/tiktok-dance-moves-choreography-history/): "Feet—traditionally fairly integral to the notion of dance—have lost significance in this genre of choreography created by teens with access to only a stationary camera. Here, all movement is confined by the need to stay in front of an iPhone front-facing camera that is probably propped up by a stack of books on a bathroom or kitchen countertop." I did this post’s dance in the small space between the end of my bed and the closet (maybe about two and a half feet wide) facing my iPhone which was precariously balanced on the window pane.

Even though this whole genre of dance is… untraditional... I still definitely enjoyed learning this and doing it to the catchy Marina and the Diamond’s sound. This one specifically feels very cheerleader and cutsey. I had to remind myself to smile and do something nice with my face while I was recording it. It’s easy to forget because there’s no audience when you’re filming in the moment, only the potential of one in the future.
