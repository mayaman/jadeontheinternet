    caption: This is another option of text I considered using. The majority of the videos on this trend say something like “pretty, average, or ugly?” Thinking about it though I felt better about not encouraging anyone else to comment “ugly!” and also not promoting more people to post videos with that as a multiple choice option.

I could not believe it when I first saw this trend on my for you page. So many people are using this sound to film videos of themselves and then ask the general TikTok user population if they look "pretty, average, or ugly" at first glance?????? Check out the references to see just a small subset of existing examples. Added a few more than usual here because I think it’s important to see how many people (especially girls) have so desperately wanted to see themselves through the eyes of another that they would opt to make themselves vulnerable to the particular ruthlessness of strangers on the Internet.

This trend is fucked up on so many levels. Watching it I want to hug every person posting a video like this and be like DON'T YOU DARE LISTEN TO THESE COMMENTS DID YOU LOOK AT THIS HATER'S PAGE THEY REPOST SHADY CONTENT AND TBH I THINK THEY ARE A FAKE ACCOUNT. Also, so many people in the comments would say things like "so much potential!!! Just try x, y, or z." Sometimes their suggestions are pretty simple like a middle part, but sometimes they are like fake eyelashes or worse a GYM. It's this kind of distilled cruelty that can only exist screen to screen and nobody would ever dare shout out IRL.

I struggled beforehand deciding whether or not I wanted to contribute for a couple reasons. First, I did not want to encourage other people to do the trend or endorse it in any way. And second, I was legitimately scared of the kinds of comments that Jade would receive because at the end of the day, Jade's face is MY FACE. Ultimately though, Jade would want to know what would happen if she posted this (and so would I), and I could not imagine what someone could say that would actually cut me too deep. I do still feel extremely uncomfortable that seeing this could prompt someone else to do the same...

I at first tried to film this without transitions, but lots of people were doing these head turn transitions and they felt important so I eventually incorporated that which is NOT as easy as it looks. Because you not only have to turn your head at the right times and in the right directions, but you also have to make sure that you set the timer to start/stop filming ahead of time to be able to capture the right clip without having to click the recording button. It’s complex, trust me.

After filming a sequence, I would watch it back and try to imagine I was seeing it from a stranger's perspective. Inevitably I wondered, will they think I'm pretty? Even though going through this ritual I am constantly consciously acknowledging it is ridiculous and should not exist, there is STILL a part of me that hopes someone out there online will say, yes indeed you are pretty you did it!

As I’m writing these words, this is already by far my most viewed video at 5427 views in three hours. (My most watched video before that has a humble 262 views and that was over 10 days ago.) The comment section is pretty active. Lots of people say “average” some even say “below average” and yeah some say pretty, but let me tell you, 13 year old me would read the comment “Average basically maybe even a little below, no hate, just my opinion, and she asked us to rate her so don’t get mad y’all.” and think about that every day for a while.

Took a total of 18 drafts before posting this one.
