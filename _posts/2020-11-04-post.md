Again, this took an embarrassing number of takes. Tried to look all luscious while I sofly informed my viewer that I have been “secretly banging” their homeboy. I absolutely love this song by SZA, but it’s interesting that this audio snippet rose to fame. Think maybe it’s because it puts the viewer in the position of imagining the person saying this has lots of sexy secrets???

This sound especially I can not imagine myself using because I actively try to distance myself from implying that someone watching me on their screen should find me ~ sexy ~ in a direct way. I never want them to think I am asking for that attention. So doing this I had to shed my internalized embarrassment (something to unpack later...) and whisper these words to my phone camera in the passenger seat of the car.
