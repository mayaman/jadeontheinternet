Okay so it is clearly election day here in the U.S. but going on Jade’s TikTok account you would barely know it! Some of this is skewed by TikTok’s algorithm which surfaces older content, but also lots of people she follows are posting as usual, so I guess Jade is going to too (my absentee ballot in PA was received though don’t worry).

Had a rare long car ride planned today and I was excited to have the chance to film some in-car content to distance Jade from feeling like she lived in a city. Lots of people seem to post videos in their car, both moving and stationary. It gives any video a very casual, filmed this quick on the go kind of feel. I always thought that these videos also tend to appear pretty unrehearsed. And maybe some people’s are! But trying to do one of these lip syncing videos for the first time I got very caught up and probably filmed 17 plus takes until I felt I had something passable to post. It was laborious. Painful, even. My pinky finger started cramping up from holding the iPhone. I was doing this, mouthing these words, holding my phone up to my face for probably over an hour total.

After I felt I had filmed enough drafts, I went through each one trying to see it from my potential audience’s POV and asked myself _Does this look casual? Do I look anywhere near as alluring as those other girls who I’ve seen do this exact same lip syncing?_ I landed on this one I think because it involved the least movement and I managed to look away from the cameras at certain moments to appear more ~mysterious~ like who is she looking at over there.

Before, every time I would watch someone do one of these lip syncing videos, I would think to myself nice, cute, obviously I could also do that if I wanted to. This proved to be an unexpected challenge… hoping my efficiency in producing these will improve as time goes on and I get more used to filming them?
