This sound is SO STICKY. After it started trending over the past few days, it was nearly constantly stuck in my head. Billie really nailed this. I keep wondering if she was like... this sound bite is going to blow up on TikTok...

I wanted to finally try to post a video using the head turn transitions and these are not perfect, but kind of work? I crafted this using the timer feature in TikTok, but it's so difficult and easy to mess up I keep wondering if there's a separate app most people use to do this???

I also filmed so many drafts of this before REALIZING Jade was not wearing her signature necklace (you can peep some necklace-less drafts in the junkyard). Very frustrating.

Jade feels like her own person here. Exciting.
