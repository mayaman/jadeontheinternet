I skimmed through some articles talking about how to gain followers on TikTok. I want to try taking some of their advice more seriously a bit later in the project (curious how things grow more organically to start), but I did decide to try one tip they had about [trending hashtags](https://whimsysoul.com/how-i-got-10k-tiktok-followers-overnight-8-hacks-to-rapidly-grow-your-following-on-tiktok/) that actually helped me make sense of why I see so many people using the same seemingly random hashtags.

So the ones that popped up for me were #RedBullDanceYourStyle #MyRecommendation and I added those instead of my usual #foryou type of ones. Returning to this a few days after it was posted though it seems to be doing the worst of any video I have posted so far. Not sure if that is hashtag related or not. Will continue to experiment.

ALSO this song is so sexual? I remember hearing it in 5th grade and having no idea what it actually meant and now I wonder how many younger people on TikTok also do not know what they are really talking about here.
