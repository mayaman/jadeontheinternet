This comment was made on [this TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@jadeontheinternet/video/6894388329048001797?sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6891999718790268421&is_from_webapp=1) I posted a few weeks back where I asked the poeple of the app what I could do to make myself more attractive. A destructive act! But it was a trend, so Jade hopped on it.

Jade only got two real suggestions: mascara (which she was already wearing) and eyeliner. I went out and bought some eyeliner specifically for this video, which I filmed over two different days about two weeks apart (you'll notice the extreme difference in hair/lighting and slight difference in top). I'd actually used it previously in some other videos, but still planned on polling the TikTok crowd here to see what they thought.

This small process made Jade's image feel like a crowd-sourced project. Here, she's asked the Internet what they want to see her change and then she delivers on their requests. It's quite a literal example of labor and purchasing in order to up her level of attractiveness. You can see in the linked references that this is pretty common for people to do on TikTok.

No comments yet, but curious to see if anyone responds to her response here. If they do, will return to this with an updated take.
