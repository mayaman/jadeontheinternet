Quick story. First, full transparency, I am now completely, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably ([sorry](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/224859-about-three-things-i-was-absolutely-positive-first-edward-was)) addicted to TikTok. Obviously, the app is built induce exactly this condition. [It's no secret.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/30/how-tiktok-holds-our-attention)

But although I'm hyper aware of this, since starting this project, I have become totally engrossed in TikTok's shiny, flickering, light up world. It's become personal. I now have a stake in the system. Jade's life depends on it.

But, I've been realizing, that my life, like the maintenance of my ACTUAL life and relationships, depends on my ability to schedule time to fully extract myself from this system, so I'm not constantly scrolling my day and mind away. SO, this week, I downloaded [the app Freedom](https://freedom.to/) to start limiting the times I am able to access "distracting websites" like TIKTOK and Instagram, etc.

But once I started using Freedom on my phone, I realized I couldn't access certain pages on TikTok as usual (like Analytics or their Community Guidelines), even during "allowed" hours. This was especially distressing given I had simultaneously decided that I was maybe potentially "shadow banned," a mental process which I unpack in more detail [here](#2020-12-15).

After reading more online, I discovered that [using a VPN could cause TikTok to shadow ban you](https://www.followchain.org/tiktok-shadowban/), and Freedom uses a VPN, so I deleted Freedom to check and finally posted this video today with a call to my TikTok audience to "let me know" if they are seeing this. I've seen other accounts post this [kind of plea](https://www.tiktok.com/@gladysdontcaree/video/6901835967590714630) [for shadow ban sympathy](https://www.tiktok.com/@avocadowithcondensed/video/6872200280755145985?sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6891999718790268421&is_from_webapp=v2) before, but this is the first time Jade has tested out the strategy before.

Turns out, based on responses from this post, I think she is NOT shadow banned, but I DO think she WAS shadow banned a couple days ago from the VPN. Okay, enough of this drama. We are over it now that we have confirmed we are no longer shadow banned, but many lessons learned through this process. Going to have to use an alternative method for blocking TikTok on my phone...
