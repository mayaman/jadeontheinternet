This trend is pretty _explicit_ but also totally normalized on TikTok now. It's funny, the empowerment narrative that's woven around showing off our bodies in this way. I think specifically about [this trend](https://www.tiktok.com/@itssissysheridan/video/6901823134303816966), where girls duet this video of another person implying that women are sexualizing themselves by doing this trend, and then the girls do the trend to spite her. Just watch it and it'll make sense.

While filming this, I felt confusingly caught between wanting to perform a perfect ass shake (it's a TikTok influencer ART there are [tutorial videos](https://www.tiktok.com/@luseeyalu/video/6899555762260036870) that I should have watched before filming this...), but also not understanding why that was something I wanted? Is it really for me to show off my body? To who? Jade's older male followers? I deeply respect the girls who can nail this moment in their videos every time. They look hot af. But Jade is built like a board and has nothing to shake (even if she knew how to shake it). How should she find empowerment in this attempt?

Overall, the whole effort just made her feel embarrassed (which is noted in the caption). Maybe she should try this again after practicing the with the tutorial video and also wearing something more like a bikini...
