Okay so, you'll see in the [DRAFT JUNKYARD](https://whoisjadeontheinter.net/draftjunkyard/) that I filmed this once, but FORGOT to set the song to go for 60 seconds instead of 15 and then had to re-do it all which was infuriating because it takes so long to film this little snippets and include mouthing the words and everything.

I filmed this a while ago, but the whole ordeal probably took me at least an hour for the first part (including the mess up and re-do). Then I actually filmed the ending on a different day. I think I didn't like the one I originally had filmed and wanted to do it on a day where there was more light.

HIGHLY recommend checking out the videos in the references on this one so you understand what I was going for. Can confirm, NOT as easy as it looks.
