This is the first time I'm trying a stitch video which just means that I can use footage from another person's posted TikTok and then add my own footage afterward. Almost like sampling.

I've often seen this used as a sneaky way to trick people into viewing your video because if you open with a video that's already proven to be popular, your video has a way higher chance of increased watch time.

Although the second clip is posed as one where Jade is meant to be looking "not cute," she doesn't feel comfortable enough right now to share something in which she truly believes she looks bad. Even her caption here, "not me," is somewhat in vain. She's asking for people to think the video's funny, but also think that she's still cute.
