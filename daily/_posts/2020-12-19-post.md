Here's the deal. I don't know how people actually do this trend. I also don't know why it's an "asian trend." I've seen some people say to show off Asian eyes? Unclear.

But, when I tried to do the mask trick, the filter did NOT exit my face. It was like [this girl](https://www.tiktok.com/@r_oh_shni/video/6905069573972757765). So, I ended up having to cheat it and manually remove the filter for the end bit of the video.
