As I am writing this, this video currently stands as my most viewed one to date. I think there's some allure in imagining who Jade is referring to when she writes "please don't let him see this." The thought seems to engage some boys in the comments... they're writing things like "Dam it must be good to be that guy" (@rafe.cochran) and "I wish some1 thought of me that way" (@real_men.simp).

This post led to a big jump in followers, but I'm annoyed that it's definitely mostly males... and definitely mostly older creeps and younger "simps" (I love that this word has just naturally entered my vocabulary now). It's uncomfortable to know that the audience Jade is performing for everyday is nearly all men and boys, staring at her dancing and lip syncing on their tiny phone screens, deciding whether or not she's worthy of a like or a follow.
