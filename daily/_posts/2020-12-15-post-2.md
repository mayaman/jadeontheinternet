I saw [this girl](https://www.tiktok.com/@jessinemec/video/6905473296540683525) duet this video and thought it was nice to see the original plus her doing it, so I copied her format for this video. This is like maybe the 6th video I have done to some form of Ariana Grande's song 35+35.

Dancing isn't Jade's main thing, but it's inevitably a big part of TikTok culture, so it's kind of become every girl on straight TikTok's thing to an extent. I've actually been thinking about it a lot and don't want to conflate Jade's identity with my own, so have purposely leaned away from portraying her as a trained dancer.

That said, it's difficult to hold back while I'm dancing, to dance in the way I believe Jade does, making faces and never hitting too hard. But truly, learning the dances is often challenging for both of us. In my head, I think I should be able to pick it up in a few minutes, when realistically it takes much longer than that. I mean, depends on the dance. I'll time how long it takes me next time to give a better sense.

Also, here I'm in an Airbnb. If anyone asks, it's Jade's cousin's house. She'll never be back in this space. I think the lighting has generally been bad in all her videos here too. The bathroom disappointed.
