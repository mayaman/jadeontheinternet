Read that it's important to reply to comments on your videos to interact with your audience. Articles say that you should "[engage with commenters and get them to continue commenting on your video](https://www.voyageandventure.com/how-to-go-viral-on-tiktok/)" and "[keep your fans engaged and reply to every comment you have](https://bigbangram.com/blog/instagram-promotion/how-to-get-famous-on-tik-tok-in-2019/)". Every comment you have seems a little bit extreme, but I did start replying to some today. A couple "ðŸ¥º thank youuuuu"s here and there. Mostly tried to avoid comments that seemed like they were coming from old creepy men. Jade enjoys every compliment at least a little bit. They confirm for her that she's being _seen_ which is the whole point of all of this for her anyway.
