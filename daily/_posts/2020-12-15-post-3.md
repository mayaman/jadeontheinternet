Okay THREE POSTS IN ONE DAY. You might be thinking, she's going wild. And you are right. I am. As is Jade. Because, for the first time ever, we decided today that we must be [shadow banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_banning).

At this point, Jade's videos usually get about 100 views on the day that they are posted. But her past three videos in her cool tie dye sweat suit have all received less than 30 views. This sent me into a long spiral of attempting to understand if I was shadow banned and what that meant. Eventually, I decided to post this old video (based on this TikTok from Madison Beer where she looks other worldy) to test things and this one already has way more views, so uh, maybe the shadow ban was all in my head.

Anyway, this whole ordeal really messed with my mental health because I was so concerned for the project's sake that I was BANNED, but it also was a true feeling of panic and paranoia that all creators must feel when their videos don't do very well relatively. Dangerous game to deposit all of your hopes and dreams into a platform that has the power to "[take down or surpress your content without formal notice](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9901461/what-is-shadow-banning-tik-tok)" and (allegedly, previously) would explicitly "[suppress posts created by users deemed too ugly, poor, or disabled for the platform](https://theintercept.com/2020/03/16/tiktok-app-moderators-users-discrimination/)." SO, when you think you're shadow banned, not only are you sad about video views, but you are ALSO haunted by the thought that, maybe, you're just not pretty enough for the platform.
