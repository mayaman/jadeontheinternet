When I started this project, I was debating whether or not I should make Jade "bad" at performing this persona at TikTok at first then show her becoming incrementally better at it.

To keep things feeling transparent, I decided she would start out doing the best she could, which honestly I thought had to be pretty close to the TikTok stars with thousands of followers. In my head I was like, _how hard could it be?_

Well joke's on me. Even though I decided not to make her intentionally look like a noob, Jade started out as a rookie anyway because I had to learn how to construct an aspirational influencer video myself.

Looking back on older videos, Jade looks more like me trying to be here and less like herself. The self she's aiming to be anyway. In this video, she is finally acknowledging the importance of lighting (this one and the last one are actually filmed in the same bathroom, just one at night and one during the day). She's willing to take over her mom's bathroom to access quality lighting. It is unclear if she lives in her parents' house or is home for the Thanksgiving holiday. Maybe time will tell.
