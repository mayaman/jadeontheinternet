This is for sure the first time I have ever put myself on the Internet with my middle finger in the air. I saw lots of girls captioning this post something like "just kidding" or "just for fun," so "just for jokes" felt right. It strikes this strange balance between doing something "bad" and simultaneously apologizing/covering up for it.

This dance is cute though. The sound is really sticky. I was re-watching this sound's videos for this blog post and now I can't get it out of my head. Classic [TikTok brain](https://slate.com/technology/2020/09/tiktok-brain-send-help.html).
